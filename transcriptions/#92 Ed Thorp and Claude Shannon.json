            "transcript": "Much useful thought and data collection has supported the idea that neither securities markets nor betting systems, prevent some ventures from gaining highly satisfactory way above average results through unusual skill. William Pounds book, Fortunes formula collects much of the modern evidence on this point in a highly entertaining way. Moreover the book contains an account of the La Palo investment record of Claude Shannon. Pioneer scientist and information theory that makes Shannon methods look much like those of Charlie Mu. Okay. So a few weeks ago when I was reading through Poor Charlie Alma, I came across that paragraph. Charlie Mu is 1 of the smartest people have ever come across. So when he recommends reading a book, it's kind of a no brainer to just order it immediately. So the the the full title of the book is Fortune formula. The untold story of the scientific betting system that beat the casinos and Wall Street and it was written by William Pounds stone. So for today, there's a lot of different characters in the book. And I'm gonna focus on 2 of them. Claude Shannon and Ed Edward Do. And both of them also have biographies, which will be featured in the next few weeks on Founder podcast podcasts. Now a note about the format of this podcast. Okay? Fortune formula is wildly entertaining, but it's written in a very odd and unique way. So some of a lot of the stuff I'm gonna share with you, they're gonna seem like non s. Because I wouldn't describe Fortune formulas as like, a cohesive narrative. It's more like, 30 or 40 individual essays that kind of tie together this theme. It ties together ties together this theme that there are people in the world that can actually have better than average performance through unusual skill. And so he... They're they're separated by, like, chapters, but I almost consider them, like essays because some of the chapters, are, like a page, maybe 2 pages, maybe 3 pages. They're very short. So what I did is I just extracted my highlights and notes that I took pertaining to the overall theme of the book, and specifically in the applications of that theme by Claude Shannon and Ed Thor. And I think we're gonna learn a lot But this this story is insane and crazy, and you'll see even more when I cover... I'm gonna cover at Do auto. Next week, it's called a man markets. This guy I an insane life as this claude shannon. Okay. So let me go ahead and jump on right in. I'm going to start with Claude Shannon, and I'm gonna go back and forth between Claude shannon and and at Thor. And I... We have to start with understanding, why Claude Shannon is so famous. It's because he invented information theory, which is basically in the foundation of our entire economy in the entire world we live in right now. And then... Specifically how they apply what they learned as academics to investing investments and making a a ton of money. Okay. So it says, life is a gamble. There are sure things. Claude Shannon was as close to a sure thing as existed. Shannon had done what practically no 1 had done since renaissance. He had single handedly invented an important new science. Shannon information theories an abstract science of communication that lies behind computers, the Internet and all digital media. It is 1 of the few times in history where somebody founded the field, asked all the right questions and answered them at once. There were many who compared Shannon insights to Einstein's. Others found that comparison unfair, unfair to Shannon. Einstein's work had virtually no effect on the life of the average human being. The consequences of Shannon work were already being felt in the 19 fifties. In our digital age where... If people were asked to characterize Shannon achievements are often a apt to be a loss to be at a loss for words. It's like saying how much influence the inventor of the alphabet has had on literature. Shannon Supreme Opus, information theory turned out to be 1 of those all encompassing ideas. I do agree with Mu when he talks about, like, why he reads many geographies because he says, I think when you were trying to teach the great concepts to work. It helps to tie them into the lives and personalities of the people who develop them. So, I've been doing that obviously in the podcast for a long, but I wanna focus a little bit about Shannon or early life and personality. He says, Shannon was born in Michigan in 19 16. He grew up in a town of barely 3000 people. There was inventing in the family blood. Thomas Edison was of distant relation. Shannon grandfather was a farmer and inventor who designed an automatic washing machine. Claude built things with his hands almost comp compulsive from youth to old age. The ability to see clean and elegant solutions to complex problems, distinguish Shannon distinguished with Shannon throughout his life. He, a little bit about his personality. He was a shy, courteous man, seemingly without envy spite our ambition. He did his best work alone. He slept when he felt like sleeping and would spent hours at the kitchen table thinking. So when I read that part, I had 2 thoughts. 1, how often does that happen in modern life? Like, how... Let me ask you the question. Like, how much do you... How much time do you spend just thinking? No input from anybody else but your own mind? And then the second thing I thought of was this this echoes what we learned when we studied Thomas Watson, the founder of Ibm. And Ibm famous for having the the word think as 1 of their company motto. And in his biography, he talks about, like, if he had something he couldn't figure out, he wouldn't go to the office. He would just sit at his kitchen table and think for several hours so he figure it out, and then he would go and go about, like, continuous day. I think they're... That's severely missing from modern life. I'm speaking my own self too. And something that I think is extremely valuable just dedicating some time to see what your thoughts are actually they are. To download the the the the computation that your brain is doing automatically. I think to do so, you need you know, some empty time where you're not having input from anybody else put your own online. Okay. Continuing back to Shannon, He would write a eccentric memo to himself. Of the memos is a list of some time passions. This gives you an idea that he was a he was... Some people say, like he was hard to focus. It's not... I don't... I didn't take that. I I think he just allow... Gave himself the freedom to focus on whatever was most interesting to him at that time. So that the list of some passion, it says it includes chess, uni cycles, juggling, the stock market, gene, running and musical instruments. So fast forwarding in his life in 19 36, He got a bachelor of science at the University of In. And the note of myself was here is, like, this guy's obviously genius, and even geniuses, sometimes don't know what they wanna do in life. And right around the time he graduates college, Claude shannon was experiencing the same thing. And he had a rather fort event. He had little notion of what he wanted to do next. He happened to see a postcard on the wall saying that the Massachusetts Institute of technology, Mit needed someone to maintain its new computer, the differential analyzer. Shannon applied for the job. So this is a very important point in is life because this is gonna be the beginning of information theory. What Shannon discovers here creates the foundation for our modern life and That's not... That's not the only reason I'm telling this. It also creates the foundation for his wild success that he has an investing. He he'll talk about what he learned from developing information theory and how he studied the stock market. They were... I think uses the word like they're almost inseparable. Alright. So let's go first to before, he he develops. So he says, Shannon understood that the differential and analyzer was 2 machines and 1. It was a mechanical computer regulated by an electric electrical computer. Remember there's no such really... There's really no such thing as what we feel is the modern computer at this time. Thinking about the machine convince Shannon that electrical circuits could compute more efficiently than mechanical linkage. Shannon envisioned an ideal computer in which numbers would be represented by states of electrical circuits, So he's fan about a world in which we live in right now. There would be nothing to lu in a lot less to break. As an undergraduate, Shannon learn b Algebra on unusual subject for engineers. B Algebra deep deals in the simple notions like true or false and logical relationships such as and or not an if. And why is that important? Because any logical relationship maybe be put together from a combination of these elements. Shannon posed himself the problem of encoding each of these logical ideas in an electrical circuit. To his delight, he succeeded. In effect, so what what was the the result of all this work? He proved that an electrical digital computer could compute anything. So I wanna take a small tangent here because there is Cameo for all sorts of historical figures in this book. And I'm only gonna mention a few, but like I said, this is 1 of the most unique books. I can definitely see why Charlie Manga recommends it. And so I wanna... I think this story about this thing called project x also illustrates, like, Chan was just a very... Like, he was a man of many talents. And what I think he did a good job of is taking all the different experiences and things he learn in life. And combining them together in unique ways later on. So project axis is an example of that. So what is project? It says, in the midst of Shannon personal crisis, he was going to divorce its time. He was offered a job at Bell Labs, Shannon accepted, This is a... There was this was the first time he he was offered a job bell labs. People say bell labs because at the time At and t had a majority... A they call, like, a benign monopoly that that it was, like, it was a place for really smart people to be able to run experiments and never worry about running out of money. Shannon is working there a bunch of other smart people are there, but he accepted the job at this time. He says, once again, Shannon turned his poly morph genius to something completely different. It was called project x, and at the time, it was classified. The only reason we know about it because it was d, like, 2 decades, 3 decades later in 19 76. So what was project X. Project x was a joint effort of Bell Labs and Britain's government code in cypher school. It had a scientific pe rival that of the Manhattan project. For the British American team included not only Shannon, but also Alan Turing. So you've probably heard that name before, I'll tell you you'll you'll realize why in case you haven't heard of Alan Turing before why he was important. I'll get there in 1 second He says, they were building a system known as Sig Sally. And that's an acronym. And that's how Pronounce. I have no idea if that's how it's pronounced. Sixth Alley was the first digitally scrambled wireless phone. This was also used during World war 2, which is why the the entire project exists. It says Alan turing cracked the German and N cipher, allowing the allies to ea drop ea drop on the German commands messages, which also led at the point of... Which also led to helping the allies defeat the nazis where we're too. The point of 6 Sally was to ensure that Germans could not do the same. Part of Shannon job was to prove that the system was indeed impossible for anyone lacking a, a key to crack. Shannon and no this is the important part why Bringing this up because it ties to everything else that we're talking about today. Shannon later said that thinking about how to conceal messages with random noise, motivated some of the insights of information theory. So we see this point, and I I just wanna stop here for a second because I see this point over and over and over again when reading biography. There's like, past learnings and experiences. Wind up playing an unexpected role in in in your future. So what... The lesson I've learned from all these biographies is like, you need to collect as much of these experiences and learnings as you can because it's unpredictable how you can apply them in the future, and that can open up opportunities that are unavailable to anybody else that did not have that unique set of experiences or learnings. Alright. So back to Shannon. A secrecy a secrecy system is almost identical with a noisy communication system. He claimed. The 2 lines of inquiry were so close together that you couldn't separate them. Shannon informed turing that he was working in a way of measuring information. And it's gonna sound familiar to you because it's the world we live in. He call... He used a unit called the bit bit was short for binary digit. So I'm gonna... I'll go into more about information theory when I read claude shannon biography in the next few weeks. So 1 thing I do... I'm gonna skip all that part now because I gotta get back to Ed thor and and the the whole point of this book. But something I I wanted to bring to point out to you right now is that it was... A lot of people criticize Shannon because, you know, he he started this new field and then kinda just abandoned it. And this is Shannon. There's 2 things that are gonna happen to what I'm about to reach you. Too. He he explains why he did that, and also talks about his other varied interest was kind of relate to his first point. Right? Just says Shannon, this is Shannon on his near abandonment of the field he created. And he says, I just developed different interests. As life goes on, you change your direction. This is, another insight in my opinion of his personality. He allowed himself to work on and think about whatever that was most interesting to him at that time. Now, what is some... Something else that he was interested and I'm currently going through. So I consider podcasts, especially when you're learning, learning, you're using them for education. Like, to me, they're just courses. Right? So so founders is just a course in the history of entrepreneurship. Right? And ours, the the the foundation of this course we're using is biographies of entrepreneurs That kinda makes sense. Right? I'm currently listening to and using Le Friedman course on, our podcasts on artificial intelligence as a course that I'm taking to learn more about artificial intelligence because I... Like, it... It's talked about constantly. It's used... They're, like, there's just no, like, concrete definition. There's different, like, a lot of different opinions. So I'm like, okay, I don't know anything about this. So what's sort of a really effective way to learn about it rapidly. And my... Like, the the outcome of my decision was like, well, let me just listen to and take notes on this this these podcasts. And the foundation of that podcast and that course is just interviews with people working in the field currently. Right? So I'm interested in this because I'm learning about it right now or attempting to learn about, I should say. But what what blew my mind when I read this book is claude shannon was interested in artificial intelligence 63 years ago. Which is also why I think it's important to study because a lot of this things people say today are really just things that people are saying 60 years ago. So that's why I was, oh, you know, when anytime you see that, that... That's a good indication that a lot of... There... There's a lot of mimic, not and not as much learning. And so I think, like, I need to dive into that. But anyways, 1 of the interests that pulled Shannon are away from information there is artificial intelligence. And Shannon organized the first major academic conference on the subject in 19 56. Just blew my mind. Alright. So now I'm switch back. I'm gonna go back and forth, and I wanna wanna introduce introduce you to Ed Thor. And like I said, next week, I'm currently, I've already started reading his his biography, which is mind blowing, and I'll cover that on next week's podcast. So this is an intro to Ed do, a little bit about his personality and a little bit about his early life. Alright. So let's go to the book. 1 friend described Ed do as the most precise man I've ever met. The z for measurement was evident from his earliest use. Ed did not utter his first words until he was nearly 3. From that moment on, Ed converse almost like an adult. So the first time his parents heard him speak was in a complete sentence, so it's kind of mind blowing. So says, from that point, forward, he converts like an adult. 6 months after that, after his for sentence, Ed knew had to count to a million. He could read and had a near photographic memory. Growing up in hard times, Ed turned his wits to making money. He bet a grocer he could total customers bills in his head faster than the grocer could use... Could using an adding machine. Ed 1, earning ice cream cones for his performance. While both parents were working, Ed and his younger brother were latch key kids. The absence of parental supervision facilitated an interest in blowing things up. Ed Whacked, homemade Nit Not sure if that's how he pronounce it. With a sled hammer to blow holes in the sidewalk. He built pipe bombs to blow craters into cliffs. He built a gunpowder propelled rocket car, interesting enough in his in his biography, he calls himself a mis fit, which I love. In spring 19 55, Thor was a physics undergraduate student at Ucla. He may do on a budget of a hundred dollars a month. His rent was 50 dollars a month plus 4 hours of work per week. Since time was money, Thor put in 50 to 60 hours a week of classes and study. He read books on psychology for tips on how to learn faster. So this is actually 1 of the I've been not only reading his biography Would have watched and taken notes on. I don't know, like 3 or 4 of his talks. And they're on Youtube. And this is something I learned from at Thor. He was fascinated with increasing a skill per hour. I've never thought about before. So he wanted, like, for his example, for example, he wanted to optimize things, like, how fast he could learn something per hour or how much money he could make per hour. Not just like, I'm not talking about oh, this is, like, the salary offering from. Literally taking how much money he tries to make it, like, in Las Vegas and and dividing it on like, a per hour basis. That's a really unique idea that I wanna I wanna, like, maintain in my own mind and kinda, like a adopt to my own life. Like, what's the the fastest I can do something and still get all, like the result I want from it. I think it's very... It's it's applicable to almost anything. Alright. So it's a grad student physics grad student, and they're at a party and they're you start having a conversation. And this is where Ed gets interested in trying to use math and physics to beat Las Vegas. And again, I have to set the foundation because the same ideas that he learns here, he applies to investing later on. Alright. So the conversation turned to ways to ways to make easy money. Someone mentioned Ro, the group was unanimous in the conviction that gambling systems are worthless, meaning, way, like, there's no point trying to figure out a way to beat them. To be beat, like, a a Las Vegas game. The discussion had to do a physics. Are Ro let wheels so perfect that predicting likely numbers is impossible. Thor and most of them arrive at conclusion that, yes. That that was the case. Thor had the most original argument. He said you can make money either way. If the wheels are physically perfect, simple physics can predict where the ball is going to go. If the wheels have flaws, some of the numbers ought to be favored. So he decides to try to solve this impossible... What quote unquote impossible problem. And this is interesting That he says that you can make money either way because he's famous for... He's like the father of Quan, 1 of the first people to to to start a quantitative hedge fund. And he calls his hedge fund a market new market neutral hedge fund. She kinda echo echoes, like, what are he's saying here about about Ra that like, you could figure out how to make money in in any environment. So while he's studying, he's trying to figure out how he can apply physics and math to beating ro, but while studying Ro, he comes across a paper that studies the odds of blackjack. He's like, oh, that's interesting. Like, I won't need because he needs a, like, a, machine. He why building, like, 1 of the first like portable computer devices, and he builds it to try to beat let. But he says, hey, I could start studying to see if I can figure out a system to beat blackjack too. So it says, until the compute, and this this thought he has is gonna lead his life into intersect with Claude Shannon. So it says until the computer age was impractical... Impractical to calculate the exact probabilities in Blackjack and many other card games. After a couple weeks he concluded that the problem was too big to solve by hand. Then he realized that he might be able to do the computations on Mit mainframe computer. It was an Ibm 07:04, a real programmable goal pro programmable electronic computer. It had some free time during the summer summer break, meaning, remember these were all shared. Like, you had a book time on it. Thor, So he's said like, okay. I'll use that, but he didn't know how to use a computer. So he had he first teach himself as a program. So says Thor taught himself the 4 tran programming language and programmed the computer himself. Thor decided to publish his system. Okay? So he wants to write a paper. He wants to have it published by other academics, but there's problem. And this is where Thor and Shannon are gonna meet. Articles had to be submitted by a national academy member, and there was only 1 academy member at Mit. Who was a mathematician. That was a famous claude Shannon. So were past the point where Shannon already invented information theory He's obviously famous at this time he's working on other things. So his thor called Shannon secretary and made an appointment to meet him. Before Thor went in, the secretary warned him that Shannon had only a few minutes to spare. He did not spend time on subjects that did not interest him. And so Shannon Thor tells him about his paper on blackjack, Shannon and Thor are about to agree to work together. So Shannon agrees to submit the paper on Blackjack. Are you working on anything else in the gambling air area, Shannon asked. Thor told Shannon about the Ro idea? Shannon was r. He was possibly more interested in the Ro gillette scheme than the black Blackjack system because there was a gadget to build. They spoke for several hours. By the time they adjourned, Thor had inadvertently set 1 of the century greatest minds on yet another tangent. It was agreed that Shannon and Thor would collaborate on building a ro prediction machine. But let me back up What a great sentence. Thor inadvertently set 1 of the century great minds on yet another tangent. Shannon said the best place to work would be his home. The device they built was a size of a cigarette pack. It contained 12 transistors and slipped into a pocket. The user needed to measure the initial position and velocity of the 2 moving objects and in the case of Ro that was the ball on the rotor. It says to do that, the user mentally picked a reference point. When a point on the rotor passed this reference point, the user clicked a tow operated switch concealed in his shoe. So this is like some oceans 11 stuff. I mean, it it's pretty crazy. They actually go to Vegas and test this out. And it's bananas. From this data, the device predicted, the segment of the wheel in which the ball was most likely to land, hence where you should be betting. Right? Now this next section is gonna give you an insight and into how their minds worked, and the level of thought that they put into this. So it says the Gillette computer was finished by late spring 19 61. In a dry run lasting a few hours, Shannon and Thor multiplied a virtual bank role of a few hundred into an impressive though fictional 24000 dollars. Thor did a full dress rehearsal and Shannon workshop. They used the finest wire practical barely as thick as a hair to connect the earphone to the pocket unit because it's gonna play a series of note musical notes in in thor ear, and each note corresponds with a a place on the the ro wheel. And thor then knows where to to to bet. Where's the most likely part where the ball's is gonna land. It says, the wire was glued to his skin with gum, then the wires were painted to match thor skin and hair. So they take this machine to Vegas. And keep in mind, this was really fascinating. Now because of the work of Thor and Shannon, there's actually laws past in the eighties by congress to outlaw what they're doing. But at this time, using your advice to predict Ro was perfectly illegal. Now it's legal, but part of the... A large part of this book is that a lot of these betting systems that people are trying to to to to beat or you're not only like they're gangster and mobs and thugs that are trying to do this, but also the people that own the casinos are also extremely violent people, which will get to in a minute. So it says, but the group knew well even though it's legal, the new well aware that the casino people would take a dim view on their experience are in their experiment. Unlike the Blackjack system, this scheme use a device, meaning the Blackjack system, they they... Event... Like, there's no way they could prove that you're counting cards. Right? They'll just kick you out of the casino, which they do do do later. But with the system, like, you can't hide a device. If they capture you and search you, they're gonna find it. So there was no denial ability. Claude stood by the wheel and recorder the numbers that came up on a piece of paper. This was a smokes screen. Claude was really timing the ball and rotor with his toe switches. So he's got switches in his feet that correspond and play that that musical note in Thor ear. The computer relayed its musical tone prediction to the better, who pretended not to know claude. The thin here's the problem I ran into. The thin wires kept breaking. Every time that happened, they had to go back to their rooms for repair. They brought so sold our iron sold irons with them. These problems prevented any serious gambling, so it was actually unsuccessful. The collaboration between Shannon and Thor ended with this Las Vegas trip. That same month, Thor got a job offer from the Mathematics department of of New Mexico State University. So we wanted have having to move across the country. So around this time, Thor like, well, I can I just spoke on my blackjack area because I then I have to worry about a machine? It's just... It's a lot easier. I could just do the math of my head. He's the 1 that kinda that him... That is credited for inventing card counting. He wrote a best selling book called Beat the dealer. That's back in the sixties that that sold well over a million copies. Alright. So this is where Thor gets the idea. Like, let me test my blackjack there, but I'm broke. I don't have any money. So, he's at a conference. Is Ed thor sending a version of the paper Shannon submitted to the National Academy. Thor titled it Fortune formula. A winning strategy for blackjack. Now you see where the where the author pound stone got his idea for his title of his book. And so he makes this this speech, it gets a lot of attention. He says Ed to decides to test his stereo in a casino. He needs someone to bankrupt him. Now this is where I left a note to myself. What's fascinating to me is Ed becomes an unbelievably wealthy man. Right? But at this time, he doesn't even have any money. He's just an academic. He's not doing that well. He got a little bit of money from from like, in advance of the book or from some royalty of the book. It winds up selling a over a million copies like, years later. It's probably at the time, but if people still buy to this days at my point. And what I found fascinating at this point is, I just told you, like, he he becomes 1 of the most successful investors ever. Right? He was 32 years old before he haven't he ever thought about finance. To me that's knowing that is like, really inspiring. And why is that inspiring? Because he... Wants to become 1 of the most successful small invisible of all time and he gets... Well, many people would consider, like, a later start in life. So anyways, as a result of this... As a speech, gambler from all over the country began calling Thor hotel to ask for copies of his paper. Someone to finance thor in the casinos for a share of the profit. Thor wanted to accept 1 of the offers. It would be fun to try the Blackjack system out in a real casino. Thor discussed the situation with Shannon. Now this is another very important point of this entire book. Shannon suggested that Thor used Kelly's formula to decide how much to bet. So another person that worked at at Bell Labs was his guy named John Kelly. And he's most famous for creating something called the Kelly formula called Kelly Criterion, it has a bunch of names. Right? But this is something that let me just... It's a mathematical form equation. Right? And I'm obviously not gonna explain that on the podcast. And to be frank, there's no way Even understand it. But the core of John Kelly's philosophy of risk can be stated without math. And it's as follows. It is that even unlikely events must come to pass eventually. Therefore, anyone who accepts small risks of losing everything will lose everything sooner or later. This is important for investors, entrepreneurs for everybody in life. The ultimate compound return rate is acutely sensitive to fat tails, Fat tails is just another way to to state on unlikely events. Okay. So Shannon, Thor. It's rumored Buffett, Mu, a bunch of other people, Mark Sp na, who, I did on Pakistan on the Dallas Capital. They all use and or know about Kelly's criterion. There's also book, Thor wrote about it. If you wanted to learn more, or you could just read the wikipedia page, but it also... I I think Gonna order the book is fascinating. But it's extremely important part of the entire book because the reason this book is important is because it's essentially like a book about the difference between entrepreneurs and academics. And the people that practice and live in the real world, entrepreneurship, are the people that live in, like fantasy Land in theory, academics. Right? And so on 1 side, in this book you have Shannon Mu, Buffett, thor. And they're saying the idea like, yes, you can you can gain an unusual advantage in life through unusual skill. On the other side you have people like Paul Samuel and other economist and academics are saying, no. The... The market is perfectly efficient. No 1 can make more money, like you're an idiot for trying. Right? And what the entrepreneurs, and it's really important how you apply to your own life is they... The reason that Buffett and Shannon and all these people wanna being successful because they understood the Kelly formula, the Kelly criterion on. The fact that you are a fool if you accept any risk. However small you think it is of losing everything. And I'm gonna tell you later on a lot of the academics that criticize thor and Buffett and the rest these guys. Why starting a hedge fund, long term capital management, which is famous and not understanding the California formula, and blowing up and needing to be bailed out by the Us treasury. So that, I'm not really ruining the point of this podcast, but I think understanding that now is gonna, it makes sense why I'm tying all these these things that seem to be unrelated together. That is a huge important part of understanding, like, what we're all trying to learn here. That you are... It is unacceptable to accept even a tiny tiny, tiny risk of losing everything. To be a successful entrepreneur, you have to first survive. If your business blows up, you're done. You're out of the game. That's that's... So that's of course, the very first thing that you should avoid. That's what Shannon avoiding with do avoiding, and see how they're that... This is what's fascinating to me. They're applying this to blackjack years before they apply to the stock market. So it's that same what I mentioned earlier how you need to collect all these learnings experiences in your life, because you never know what you could apply to later. This idea they were just tinkering around with casino and, casino games, winds up making them wealthy. Shannon Shannon point like less wealthy, because it he has a a fantastic rate of return, but he also... Didn't really care about, like, accumulating wealth. He had a very. So anyways, I'll get there. Alright. So it says, Thor decided that the best offer was the biggest 1. A syndicate of 2 Wealthy New Yorkers was offering a hundred thousand dollars. Now this is... Would be over a million dollars today. To take on the Nevada casinos. Thor dialed the number on the letter and asked to speak to a manual kim. So this is the the only part of the podcast where we're gonna get into like, all these underworld figures because it's fascinating. And if you're interested in that kind of stuff. I would recommend reading the book. Again, don't even listen to me. Charlie Mu how to read it, you should probably read it. So this is an intro to Manny Kim, and emmanuel Kim known as Man Kim. And I'm gonna... He's also tied to this other gangster, I, literally, these are Mafia guys. This a wi. I don't know how to pronounce his name, but there's a reason I'm bringing that up. I'm not just doing it because I I found it entertaining. Alright. So first, let's let's talk about Manny, because to understand Thor, and the wild crazy life he has. You have to understand some of the people he associated with. He didn't know they were mafia. Like, he he was kind of... He found out later and then he he stopped associating with them, obviously. But he was very much, you know, the land of horse betting and casinos and and marketing manipulation, also they're kinda of crazy stuff is, you know, there's gonna be a lot of you know, organized crime in it. Alright. So Manny Kim. He would... Man would bid on anything at any time, as long as the odds were to his liking. Kim will taught himself calculus tri and probability theory or at Least he said he had, and I don't know if he ever did. Within his brain was a combination of street smarts and auto diet book learning that could swiftly analyze propositions. He was, you know, rather smart though. I just don't know if he knew all the other stuff. He memorized I sucker bets. 1 of his favorite 1 of his favorites was betting that 2 people in a group would have the same birthday. Kim victims would take even money. Kim knew he had an edge whenever there were more than 22 people. Kim edge was not always strictly mathematical and not always strictly ethical. So let me go back to Thor and Kim. Kim appeared to be interested only inviting out whether Thor system worked. He he showed no interest in paper. And as far as thor could tell, the math greek to Kim. Kim demanded that they play each other. Thor flew New York each Wednesday to play cards against Kim. He won regularly, convincing Kim was playing skills in the merit of the accounting system. Kim occasionally presented Thor with a gift of a salami. I just included that. Because when I read it, we made me laugh. Like, alright? Thanks for beating me, Salami. Alright. Now to this is a... The... Another... I keep saying this how how many crazy surprising things are on in this book, but this is 1 of really crazy 1? So Kim is involved with this guy named Sw. And he is definitely a mafia guy. And the reason I put this in the story is because Thor is gonna run into some of these people. And I think just something you should learn in life that thing is obvious like, there are some people in life that you should just not mess with. And I always go back to, like, that book I did on Ko Van belt where, yeah, he's a businessman man he's an entrepreneur Yeah he's the wealthiest person in the world of time, but he also will will break the law and try to have you killed if you go against him. If you remember what he did to in the book, the Ty war when when, somebody thought they had a good idea of con some of the ships. He went and sent, like, Assassins and mercenaries and other countries armies after them. So you just have to understand it in life, like, there's just certain people that don't care about rules. And if you mess with them, like you could have consequences, which is what makes with thor is doing right now extremely dangerous. And this is an example of somebody, this... I'm gonna call Wi because it's ZWI. We're gonna call Wi. Wi is he he has a a racket, a numbers racket, which is a way for people to gamble, which is very popular at the time for for the way, certain mafia figures make money. So it says a minor thug named Leo began rough up Wi numbers runners. He was given a warning. Leo responded that he'd kicked woman in the balls to teach him a lesson. Wi insisted on handling this insult personally. He tracked Leo to a bar to a bar and shot him once in the testicles. So woman has all these other... Like, he's extremely wealthy. He made money, like, off prohibition running running a legal liquor into the United States. He's a bunch of gambling businesses. He owns like, part part owner in, like, bunch of parking lots, like all kinds of stuff. So something happens where Woman dies. And it looks like he committed to his suicide most likely he was murdered by other mafia members. Okay? Now the reason I'm bringing this up is because when Woman dies, Man is then, he's he benefits from woman's death, Well, let me treat it. Woman's death left Manny Kim will holding a portfolio of businesses, Okay? Some legitimate and some not. Some owned by Kim and others apparently in partnership with Woman's estate and other Murky entities. Wi had an idea for par laying this wealth. That idea was to try to beat to gamble and not only the the the the Las Vegas casinos, but also the stock market. Now the reason I bring this up is because this is 1 of the most surprising facts in the book is that the businesses that Wi and Manny own together it starts out, like really successful. They own, like, 60 something parking lots in in in New York city, and I think they... The revenue on the parking lot something like, a million over a million and a half dollars a day or something like that. And 1 of the strangest twists in life, that business winds up becoming warner communications, which is today known as warner media, which is a huge media conglomerate. That thing just blew my mind, how how, like, these these things could start it's so unrelated and and over time morph into something like unpredictable. Okay. So back to to Manny, that's the end of Woman in the story. Let's go back to Manny and Thor. So they go to Vegas. Kim will pulled out a water of bills and count out 10000 dollars for Thor. Thor started gambling. They won 500 dollars and 15 minutes, and then the dealer press the second the secret button on the floor. So I'm just skip over more major parts of the book, but what's happening here is they don't care if they can prove your counting cards or if you have a system for being blackjack. When you're too successful, especially at this time, they immediately start cheating or kicking out a casino or in some cases, trying to kill you. So, eventually, they're all identified... They're identified at all the casinos to go to. So they walk in a casino and they're immediately like, pushed out. So they're may... They they make money though. And again, man wanted to start with a hundred thousand dollars. Thor was the 1 that brought it down to 10. Right? You can imagine how much money they would have made if they would started with a hundred thousand dollars. But this is so once they become too well known in Vegas, it terminate their experiment. Now here's a result of that. By Thor, they had built 10000 dollars into 21000 dollars in about in about 30 per... In 30 hours of play. Head and that was after Kim wasn't listening the Thor and wind up burning through 11000 dollars. Like, he didn't know what he was doing. So essentially, it should have been 32000 dollars, but it was... They made 20... They made 11000 dollars So says, this is how profitable per... And this is how 4 thinks about it. He breaks it down profitable per hour. Thor system, 11000 dollars, profit in 30 hours. It's 366 dollars per hour playing blackjack. If if man didn't mess it up, they would have made 733 dollars. Per hour. So it's itself safe to say that that that Ed has thrown a way to indeed beat the dealer. And now is a system effective, but he's also using the Kelly system Kelly Criterion to figure out how much bet I wanna talk you a little bit more about that real quick. And again, it's it's it's just states that even in unlikely events must come to pass eventually. So it says given a favorable betting opportunity. The Kelly system promises maximum profit and protection against ruin. The reason I think it's important because according to ed thor and others, this is the single best system to build wealth. Okay? Alright. So given a favorable betting opportunity, The Kelly system promises maximum profit and production against your ruin. These go goals may sound anti hypothetical. It is worth note looking at how the Kelly formula works in a casino situation. The Kelly system avoids gambler ruin quite simply. It is a proportional betting system. That means that each wage scale to the current size of the bank role. Since you bet only a prescribed fraction of what you currently got, you can never run out of money. When you lose repeatedly as will happen in any game of chance, bet scaled down in proportion to your diminished wealth. The exponential growth of wealth in the Kelly system is also a consequence of proportional betting. As the bank roll grows, you make larger bets. Assuming you have an edge and that is the biggest biggest biggest part, 1 of the biggest parts. Maybe, no, let me say it's the biggest part. Assuming you have an edge. In the long run, you will win more than you lose. This is important to investors. It's important to entrepreneurs. There's no point in starting a business if you don't feel you have an edge. Buffett, Mu, Thor and Shannon All agree. If you don't have an edge, you don't bet and you don't compete. Now, what's so special about the specific system that Kelly devised? The answer is simply that the Kelly system grows wealth faster than any other. Alright. So let's go back to Ed do. At this point, it's it's funny to me because if you really think about the life story of Ed Do. He's a kid that's born poor, and yet he goes on to learn and build more wealth than he could ever spent. And the reason he he moves across the country starts working with Shannon is because he needed the money. New Mexico state offered a salary of about 50 percent more than Thor making. Living cost would be much less as well. The money weighed heavily on Thor as he and his wife were now raising a family. So Thor accepts the offer. Thor writes a best bestselling book called Beat the dealer, and then he starts using his count... Counting system to make some side money. So now he's going to other... Now he's on his own. He's not with Manning, and all these other Mafia guys. He obviously realizes they're in a mafia by now. So as doing some press for beat the dealer, he gets profile by a magazine, and it says, the 19 66 magazine profile and Thor contained probably the first mention of the Kelly system in a general publication. And he says, 1 of the most ingenious aspects of thor strategy today involves his application of the Kelly system. A mathematical theory for the management of capital conceived by Bell Bell Labs research scientist. That's John Kelly I mentioned earlier. It is this element of play which ensures him against going broke. The man or woman who constantly over bets even in favorable situation is certain to do so. So this is the problem though. He's drawing a lot of attention to himself. So even if they don't... They... They're not recognizing him because he's walked into their casino before, he starts... They... People obviously in their gambling and to share gonna hear about his book. And so even though Thor is playing on his own, the casinos fight back. And this is what I mentioned earlier. Like, there's no rule in life that's saying that other humans are gonna play by the rules. And if you don't understand that, you could put yourself in a very dangerous situation, and Ed almost died doing so. Says, no interference from casinos was becoming unrealistic assumption. While playing at 1 casino Thor was offered to drink. After drinking it, he noticed he had problems concentrating. Thor staggered up from the table and got to his room. His eyes were dilate. It took about 8 hours for the effect to wear off. I know of 3 beating store said. 1 was a well known blackjack card counter, and he had his... And he had a lot of his face caved in. A guy, another guy I know had his arms held and every time he try to catch his breath, they'd punch him in the solar plexus. So he's like, this is stupid. I... I'm gotta find a different way to do this. And he realizes, This is where Shannon and thor started applying what they learned from gambling to the stock market. And they believe that the idea that markets are perfectly efficient to be false. Again, I I've kind of talked about this a lot of a past few because Buffet mentions it over and over again to shareholders letters, mon talks about it, and we'll we'll get into here. I says, I'd be a bum in the street with a 10 cup. If the markets were efficient, warren Buffett once. Warren Buffett once said. Buffet had already made a name for himself with a successful hedge fund, and it had founded Berkshire Hathaway. When Paul Samuel, this is the guy that's popular that popularized efficient market theory wrote that a loose version of the efficient market a random walk hypothesis accord with the facts of life. The truth is this is Paul Samuel still talking. The truth is, and that's that's this is what he thinks. He says this truth it must be emphasized, is a truth about New York, Chicago and Omaha. His Samuel was apparently felt that Buffett success was best filed with a small minority of unexplained cases. So this is my problem with Paul Hamilton is he had, like, the book says it had spirited advocacy for the efficient market hypothesis the Swiss swept the academic community in 19 sixties and seventies. He went winning a nobel prize for this theory. My problem is Samuel was a liar. Because he's he's talking about, oh, he... He's a very common condescending to people that don't agree with it. He calls them fools and everything else. And yet, he's... So he's talking about, like, this is stupid. Like, you're dumb for believing this and he he's preaching that you should just, you know, just... You shouldn't even try. And but so that's what he's saying with his mouth. But what is he doing with his actions? He's buying Berkshire Hathaway stock. So that tells you he doesn't believe what he's saying. Buffet met... It was just interesting to me when I was reading a shareholder letters. Buffet kept mentioning a person who popularized Emt, which is fisher market dairy. But who's also a berkshire investor. It wasn't until I read Fortunes formula that I knew he was referring to. And so that's that... That's something III, like, I hold Dear in my life and something that has help helped me is, like, I try not to pay attention what people say. I try to pay attention to what they do. I think our actions reveal... Like, the... It's it's a difference between, like, revealed preference to stated preference. Like, you just watch what they do. And you'll see what they actually believe in. And so in his case, like, he obviously didn't believe that, because if he wouldn't think he could make above market average above average market returns by investing in a single stock, which is what he was doing. I don't I... I hate people like that. It it bothers me. It's like they're... III consider it lying. Alright. So let's go back to S So in late 19 50, Shannon began an intensive study of the stock market that was motivated both by intellectual curiosity and a desire for gain. He filled 3 library shells with something like a hundred books on economics and investing. At the time he was designing the Rule computer with Thor, Shannon kept notes in an Mit notebook. Part of the notebook is devoted to a wildly disconnected set of stock market mu. Shannon wanted about the statistical structure of the markets random walk, whether information theory could provide useful insights. This is how he's supplying something he learned 2 decades prior or decade and a half earlier to what he's doing now. He considered margin trading and short selling. Stop loss orders and the effects of market panic. Capital gain taxes and transaction costs. He notes of such success stories as the Lone Wolf who ran about 10000 dollars into a million into about in in 10 years, and He Green, the witch of Wall Street, who ran a million into a hundred million in 30 years. This is shannon specifically in the efficient market theory. You know the economist talk about the efficient market where everything is equal out, and nobody can make any money. Really, it's all lock and so on, Shannon 1 said, I don't believe that's true at all. So Shannon starts to make a lot of money in the stock market, and that we're gonna be introduced to another person who also is who... We... We've also... You might have heard the name from Charlie Mu and Warren Buffett, and that that person's Henry Singleton, who I'm also reading a book about and will appear on a future founders episode. Says in 19 54 Charles Harrison, a bell lab scientist, Shannon New started his own company. Harrison laboratories made power supplies for the promising new field of color television. Shannon bought a block of stock. Harrison labs is not a familiar name today because it was acquired by Hp back in 19 62. The stocks price zoomed and Shannon got a handsome chunk of he packard stock in the merger. The size of the paper profit convinced him there was real money to be made in stocks. So he continues the experience with Harrison made Shannon receptive when another friend Henry Singleton spoke of starting his own company. By 19 60, Singleton founded Tele, a defense contractor selling digital navigation systems to the Pentagon. Shannon brought a couple thousand shares at the initial price of a dollar a share. By 19 67, it hit 24 dollars a share. As the company shares Skyrocketed, Singleton used that inflated market value to buy other companies. He bought about a hundred and 30. Tele came to down insurance companies, offshore oil wells, and the manufacturer of the water pick teeth cleaners. So I think Buffett, he says something like Singleton is the single best all of capital in history. And once I heard that, I was like, okay. Well, I got... I definitely have to read about this person he sounds fascinating. Alright. At Thor starts investing stocks and why does he do that? He says, I realized that if I pushed it sooner or later, some unpleasant physical things would happen in Nevada. He decided to direct his talents toward the biggest casino of all, the stock market. So he starts out, but he doesn't really know too much about investing. And he loses a large percentage of a little money. He has speculating on silver, and he learns a very valuable lesson. It kinda ties into buffet Buffett ideas, and among others, about never betting or investing your time or money in an area where you have no edge. So Thor says, I learned an expensive lesson read it regarding all the money lost and Silver. And he says the lesson was you were unlikely to get an edge out of what you see in the news. So Thor decides hey, I gotta look where grab an edge. He has some unique insights on options and warrants. And at this point in his life, Ed thor is gonna move to Southern California, and he's gonna start his work on options. He switches schools to uc Uc Irvine. Officer just says, summer 19 64 brought changes in Thor life. The grant supporting his appointment at New Mexico state had worn out. On T first day at Uc Irvine, he had happened to mention his interest in warrants to Julian Feldman, the head of the computer sciences department. Oh, Feldman said, we've got a guy who's doing the same thing. He was talking about the economist named Sheen Cass. Feldman introduced Thor to Ka, and they resolved do a weekly research seminar in the subject. But there were no students. Thor and Cass off simply met weekly to figure out how to get rich Thor began trading warrants. His hedging system, and he calls this the delta hedging system. And his hedging system hoped or said his hedging system worked as he had hoped by 19 67, Thor had par his original 40000 dollars into a hundred thousand dollars. So thor writes a letter Shannon, and he tells him. He's like, listen, after several 4 starts, I have finally hit paid dirt with the stock market. I have constructed a complete math mathematical model for a small section of the market. A major portion of my modest resources has been invested for several months. We said a tentative first goal of doubling the capital every 2 years. It isn't far away now. So Thor wanted up being successful. He wanted wanting to run money for other for other people for outside investors, so he writes a book, publishing his system. And then he's looking for partners. And you have to pick, lesson. Is you have to pick the right business partners. And the reason Thor doesn't pick Cass off because there's a philosophical difference. So it says, Cass believed that he could sometimes predict in which directed direction certain stocks were going to move. Cass was willing to buy stocks. He thought were going up and sell short stocks he thought were going down. Thor wasn't. He was un that Cass off or anyone could predict the market that way. So he winds up the annoyed left myself is Store finds the right partner and starts a hedge fund. I find out later on that. That might... I've been in the case. He definitely started a hedge fund, not sure he's he found the right partner. But now this is gonna... This is the beginning of 1 of the most full hedge funds of all time, and it's called Princeton Newport and Thor finds this guy named Reagan Reagan. And Thor lives in California Reagan lives on the East Coast, and it what what blew my mind is Thor starts working remotely. And this is I think back in... Inserting back in the sixties. Alright. So this is Thor talking. He says, Re Reagan was a natural promoter and extra bird. He was gonna have... He was going to do the things I didn't want to do, which were, like, interface with brokers, accounting, run around Wall Street getting information that sort of thing. What I wanted to do was think, workout theories and try to put them into action. We were actually happy being separate because we had different styles and very different personalities. Being separate was 1 of the odd parts of this arrangement. So the time about the fact that this this is a remote company. Thor did not wanna give up his Uc Irvine post our California. It's kinda crazy that he he's running 1 of the most hedge funds, and then he finally quits years later, but It's kinda shows you how cautious he is. It was agreed from the outset that would be a bi partnership connected by a wire, a wire of phone and data lines. Thor and a staff would do the math in California. And they would transmit trade instructions to Regan to... Yeah, to reagan and staff on the East Coast. The East Coast branch would handle the business and of things, including most of the recruitment of investors. Now along this time, Thor is trying to get people invested with him, 1 of them is a dean at you seen Irvine, and this is where what leads him to meet a young warren buffett. This is still in the 60. So they're probably in the thirties. They're, like, let's say late thirties maybe at this time. Says before committing any money to Thor, this guy's name's Gerard. Gerard wanted his money manager to meet Thor and size him up. The manager was warren Buffett. Thor and wife, Thor and his wife met Buffett and his wife for a night of bridge. Thor was impressed with Buffett breath of interests. He believed that Buffett will 1 day become the richest man in America. Buffett verdict on Thor was also positive. Gerard who had done quite well with Buffett decided to invest with Thor. And so they're kind of bonding over the fact that their Thor Shannon and Buffett, they're the direct opposite of this idea that the market is efficient And Thor says, the question wasn't is the market efficient, but rather how inefficient is the market and how can we exploit this? So Thor approach is completely different than others this at this time. And anytime you're gonna do anything different, you can be be expected to be criticizing me told they are wrong. So now as he applying math, but he's using computers. And so the Wall Street Journal does a story on Thor and his new Princeton newport hedge fund. And, the journal... It says the journal writer was a maze that Thor disregard a fundamental analysis and his reliance on computers. In 19 74, the journal average reader had as much hands on experience with computers as with moon rockets. The whole computer model bit is ridiculous because the real investment world is too complicated to be reduced to a model, an unnamed mutual fund manager was quoted as saying, you can't replace the money manager using security analysis and market feel with a machine. Yet the journal reported that T machine, outperformed all but 1 of the 400 mutual funds tracked. Is this thor on it. The... On the 1 that beat. He says the better 1 was 1 of those crazy funds that invested only in gold stocks. And so let I'm me gonna just fast forward it a little bit here. Now this is the update on the progress of Thor first company. I just wanted you to notice that I said first company. At at fiscal, at as at the year end of 19 82, Thor and Reagan could boast at a dollar invested at the outset had grown to 6 dollars and 61 cents in 13 years. By that time, Thor and Reagan had turned a conviction that the market can be beaten into 1 of the most successful in investment partnerships of all time. It was rare enough to cheat to achieve greater than market return over 13... Consecutive years. Skeptical academics and some traders tended to judge such exceptional performance as a fo bargain. They said sooner or later, they were gonna lose big. Thor remember, but what's gonna prevent them from losing bit. Pick the Kelly Criterion. Right? Thor was intros, approaching the challenges of his work as a scientist. I think this is also a smart way for entrepreneurs to do so. He measured his words like he measured everything else. Thor was careful to characterize his son's for his funds performance as getting rich slowly. So what I mean about approaching things as a scientist. Is like, he has a theory, then he needs he needs to test that theory in the world world. And as a result of testing your theories in the world, you're gonna get unexpected results. That's what I meant about that. Okay. Not so it it took him until 19 82 until he quit his day job teaching at you see Irvine. So that's pretty crazy. That's what. Close to 15 years. Thor was slow to display his now considerable wealth. In the office, he dressed like a California professor on his day off in shirts and sandals. When the thor finally decided it was time to buy a big house, they chose a hillside 10 bathroom home, said to be the largest in newport beach. Kinda gives you an idea of how he's doing? I've seen interview interviews. He won't tell how much money he's made? It had it had a fallout shelter with 16 inch thick concrete walls and steel doors. And why do I bring that? Like, why am I including that part in the podcast. Not just talk about big houses. Is because it gives you insight into his mind. Ever mindful of the odds, Thor computed that it could withstand a 1 mega mega ton hydrogen bomb blast as close as a mile away. Neither Thor Nor Reagan could have imagined how soon it would all end or how, and there's gonna be another... I... Feel like I keep saying that over and over again, but there's another insane story in the book, how their hedge headphone winds up coming to an end. So there's this illustration I really like and it tell... It will tell you how the proponents of the Kelly side are thinking about things. So I'm gonna read it to you. The growth of dollars under our various money management schemes may be compared objectively, like the growth of bacteria and petri dishes. K? So just think about it as a money management system. The dollar subjected to the Kelly system survive and grow faster than those subjected to any other system. The experiment can be repeated as many times as it takes to convince the skeptic. And then you ask which system would you prefer for your money? An asset test of Princeton and Newport market in neutrality came in a black... In the form of the black Monday crash in 10/19/1987. The Dow Jones lost 23 percent of its value in a single day. The biggest single day drop ever. Princeton Newport 600000000 dollar portfolio shed only about 2000000 dollars in the crash. Do computer immediately began alerting him to rich opportunities in the panic valuations. Princeton Newport closed October 19 87 just about even for the month. Most mutual funds were down 20 percent or more. Princeton and news sports return for the year was an astonishing 34 percent. Black Monday was also a severe test to the efficient market hypothesis. It was difficult for many to see how a rational assessment of the market's value could have changed 23 percent in a single day. Black black monday caused... And this is the the the... I mean, it's... I was gonna say this surprising result, but kinda not surprising when people identify themselves with their ideas. Like, a good good advice is, like, you're or not your ideas, you should, like, discard them when you find information that clearly contradicts them. Well, the economist didn't. Black Monday caused few economists to reject the efficient market I hypothesis this. Alright. So now I gotta tell you when Thor hedge fund is rated. And you might be saying what... Then no left myself as Wtf. Like, when I got to this part of the book. So what what are you talking? What what's was going on here? Alright. December 19 87, vans pull up in front of Princeton and Newport building. They contain 50 federal agents of the Fbi treasury department Atf. They were armed and wearing bulletproof vests. They went through the filing cabinets packing documents into 300 boxes. They were under their orders to look for audio tapes especially. So as when Ed heard the news his an initial reaction was that it was nonsense. He had followed followed the string of arrest on Wall Street like everybody else. This is happening at the time. The raid seemed to be some publicity stunt on the part of Rudy Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani is the prosecutor of the Southern New York, and a lot of people are saying he was doing this to to get public publicity for eventual run at either senator and governors partnership. Now here's the problem though. Did... I said earlier, it's important to pick the right business partners. And then I looked, myself I was like, oh, did Do actually have bad business bad partner. Ominous ominous, Reagan did not have much to enlighten thor. Everybody lawyer up, explain Thor. Trying to run a partnership was very difficult under these circumstances. Actions spoke louder than words. Some of the East Coast partners took about 15000000 dollars out of the fun and replaced it under the names of their wives. So that looks real bad. Doesn't it. It turned out that someone had saved some tapes from December 19 84. This is 3 years earlier. Stock parking would normally plague place at the end of the texture. So that's what they're doing. At the time, Thor, and his partner have a, 1 of their brokers is Michael Mill, Milk, the famous guy who one's inventing junk bonds and going to jail for a few years. And reagan and some of the people in the office. Well, I don't if Reagan was actually involved, but some traders in the office were doing this thing called stock parking, which would... They would... Basically 2 different companies are are pretending to to transfer assets to 1 another to avoid taxes. That's like a overs simplified way to think about it. Right? But this is going on in the east coast office. Thor didn't know what's going on. So Thor got 1 call from the prosecution team. They wanted him to come and testify New York. And he told them. If I do it, I'm gonna take the fifth. The Us office attorney took no... The Us attorney's office took no further direction against thor. So he was never even involved in all this. And he says my theory on I'm taking the fifth was, I didn't know anything. So if I had... So I had no upside in going in and plenty of downsides. So was another trait that I find constantly from the the in these biographies, these people know how to to limit to cap their downside. The decision to test if I was just a prudent calculation. And here's the problem. It didn't matter that he didn't do anything. Because that they they were being charged. The people that they were guilty, and they're... Julian is using the Rico act, which is mainly used to fight, like, organized crime. With So this is the end of their hedge fund. Where Rico charges looming, the funds investors wanted out. In 19 88, Thor and Reagan dissolve the partnership. Positions were liquidate in the money returned to investors. He blames the situation on the dysfunctional partnership. We didn't really connect well his people. Thor said of himself in Reagan. That was probably the crack and the Edi. If I'd realize the actions were being taken, they were more aggressively bold, closer to the line and I dare contemplate the whole thing wouldn't have happened. And Ed was pretty mad about this because he's like, had a great run, and you're trying to, like, save a little bit on taxes. So he says this is the financial results of their partnership. To many portfolio managers today, the nate 18 year record of Princeton Newport partners is the definitive home run. A dollar invested in the fund at the beginning would have been close to 15 dollars by the time the fund ceased. Over 19 years, the compound return rate averaged 15.1 percent. After fees. During that same time period, the S and p averaged 8 percent. So again, Samuel, another say it's impossible to do, and Thor doesn't care if you think it's possible we'll just go ahead and do it. And this is him on the end of the Princeton and Newport, Reagan and other prince and Newport defendants appealed their cases. All 6 convictions were overturned. So they might have not not even being able to convict them permanently. Thor came out un unscathed from charges. But What he's upset about is they interrupted are compounding. So this is a destruction of wealth was huge thor preserved. The partnership employed about 80 80 people on 2 coasts. They managed 272000000 dollars of other people's money. Together, Thor and Reagan were collecting 16000000 a year in general partner fees. This is in the eighties. Their own investments in the fund were compounding in an impressive rate and what happens? You've never ended up compounding. And Rico case is gonna interrupt your compounding. So he's he's really upset about that. From there on end, He he just... He runs this thing called Ed Edward Do and associates like, a series of of hedge funds. I'm not sure if he invest other people money. I think he does, but I think most. He just runs his own money too. And he's getting, like, 20 something percent returns. So that's what he's been doing from the the point in this the story today. He's still alive. He's 87 years old, and he wrote his memoirs was 2 years ago, and then he did a lot of publicity. At 85 years old for the book. I recommend you just putting at Edward Thor or Ed thor into into Youtube. And I've showed the video to 3 or 4 different people now. Everybody's... I was like, hold a that, guy? Tell me how hell is. Look, I don't know. 60 65. It's remarkable. I've never seen an 85 year old person. Look as good to him, and then not only that, like, still be so point mentally. It's remarkable. Alright. So now I wanna get to the point that... Now we know that thor did well. I wanna talk with the people that thought... So I wanna talk about the... The idea that that there's people that were not adhering to the Kelly criterion who wind up blowing up. So Thor had a chance to get to invest in Lt, which is long term capital Management. 1 of the most famous, like, hedge funds to blow up ever. And he declines for obvious reasons. So it says, ed ed first heard of Mer weather Mer weather is the person that starts that begins Lt. So he's first heard Mary Fund through a mutual fun... Friend. It's gonna be a great investment therapist told, and for 10000000 dollars you can get into it. Like most of the new group of fund managers, Mary promised better than market returns through science and software. May weather did not himself possess a first rate medical mine. Instead he recruited the top academic talent. No finance professor was more respected than Robert C Mer. So he recruited him. And his other greatest coupe was recruiting My skull sc. Now here's the thing. They also believe in efficient market hypothesis, but they're saying is there's tiny, tiny, tiny parts, temporarily where the market is not efficient, and you can make, like, 5 cents. Their point is they're gonna use a massive amounts of leverage so they could pick up a bunch of nickel. But what they're really doing is they're picking a bunch of nickel in front of a steam rolling. They just don't know that they're doing that yeah. Okay? So says Thor said not to put any money in this fund. He was concerned that Mer sc had little experience investing other people's money, and it didn't help that Mer was a critic of the Kelly Criterion. The general chatter was also that Mer weather was a high roller. The story was that if he got a hole, if things went against him, he would bet more. If things still went against him, he'd bet even more, and this is what winds up doing... What what he winds up doing at at Lt. It's kind of the exact opposite of when I was describing a Kelly criterion to you earlier. It's a proportional betting system as your bank goes up, you bet more as it goes down, you bet less. What happens is Lt starts blowing up and they bet more. A larger percentage. It says Lt trading secrets were secrets. 1 thing was disclosed. Lt used a lot of leverage. For every dollar invest investor money, the fund borrowed 29 dollars more. So this is this is the definition of Gambler ruin. This is also the way I want you to think about this is, this is what Thor and Shannon wisely avoided. This is... And this is an Lt did not. 1 term for Gambler ruin among the traders is blowing up. To blow up an account is to lose everything in high risk trades with borrowed money. A stellar career can end in a few miserable days or ours. And so there's a there's a quote. If you listen to the podcast did last week on Jim Clayton that he compares, and we've talked about this a lot? The the fact that starting a company running a company a lot of times, it's counterintuitive. Right? You the thing you think your should do is the exact opposite what you should be doing. That's what makes it difficult. Right? And it's a complex adaptive system. It's it's not not gonna behave in ways that are predictable. So Jim compared that to flying because he's a pilot too. And he says he's that something that I thought about, And I I, I've, like, kept the note. And he says, the thing you should do is the opposite. Like, you can get yourself in a situation flying in a business where the thing you should do is the opposite of what you feel you should do. So Lt runs into the same thing. They're they're collapsing. And in the middle of the collapse, they do the exact opposite thing that they should. It says when they first started losing obviously, they had less discretionary wells, so they should have pulled down their leverage multiple on a proportional basis. Right? Instead, they allowed that leverage to drift up to, like 60 times. That was a horrible mistake. No Las Vegas gambler would ever make that mistake. No surviving 1. And so that is the almost the entire point of this podcast. Is to never put you wanna put yourself in a position. You cannot be successful, you don't survive. So therefore, never risk your survival ever. These guys didn't even understand that. They came from a different world. They thought, oh, we have it all figured out. We're so smart. And so III wanna read this quote. Well, let me get to it. Warren Buffett is gonna... You y, I don't even need to say because Warren Buffett quote here is amazing on it. And then the this next part I'm gonna read you. When I left... When I I read it, III left a note to myself. And it's that Steve Ai quote, the guy from the big short who made over a billion dollars shorting the the the, during the housing crisis and the financial crisis in 2008 2009. And, It's just amazing how many situations this quote applies to. And he says, the the quote is like, they must mistook leverage for genius. And Ai was talking about the 2 thou... The late 2 thousands financial crisis. This it can the same thing applies to what's happening then in the nineties and we'll apply in the future and a hundred years in the future, hundred years ago, This is human nature and human nature does not change. So many of the partners have substantial fortunes before Lt that they rolled over into the fund. 1 partner was to be set was said to be in tears in 1 meeting. Why would you be tears? Because he had taken out a personal loan of 24000000 dollars to increase his stake in the fund. What is he doing? He's using leverage to buy his own fund, which itself was operating at... Nose bleed leverage levels. His net worth went from something like over a hundred million dollars to negative 20000000 dollars. He requested that the bailout covers personal debts. Remember, it's just such a huge loss. The Us Treasury had to bail them out. The consortium said no. And what a jerk? Sky wants the taxpayer to pay... I mean, that why am I even surprised or something like this? Like, I should know better right now. He requested that the bailout covers personal debts. Like, that's that's a terrible person. Now, this is what I was mentioning earlier. I love this warren Buffett Marvel than how 10 or 15 guys with an average iq of maybe a hundred and 70 could get themselves into a position where they can lose all their money. And that statement our Warren Buffett is really just echoing something a statement that was said 200 years in the past in 17 38 by this guy named Danielle B be. I don't how to pronounce it. He's credited with, like, being made maybe even, like, the most pioneering work in probably building statistics. And this is what he said this is what he wrote in 17, a man who risk his entire fortune acts like a simple. However, great may be the possible gain. They're telling you to avoid there's... You should avoid risk of ruin. You should avoid fat tails. Says thor link the Lt now this is store on it. Link the Lt collapse to mu trolls intellectual critique of the Kelly Kelly system. So Ed continues. He says, I could see that he didn't understand how controlled the danger of extreme risk and the danger of fat tailed distributions. It came back to haunt them in a grand way. Estimates about market probabilities are always just going to be that estimates. It is a good practice to have a sense of how far off these estimates may be. Margins of error are themselves estimates, and human nature often skews these estimates optimistic. A decade rarely passes without a market event that some respected economist claims with a straight face to be a perfect storm. It 10 sigma events or a catastrophe so fantastically improbable that it should not have been expected to occur in the history, entire history of the universe. If they keep happening, that means they should be expected. Shouldn't they? Like, that's obvious on its face. I don't understand how so called smart people don't understand that. In a world war financial models can be so incredibly wrong. The extreme downside caution of Kelly Bedding is hardly out of place. Alright. So now we're gonna go back to Claude Shannon, and this is Shannon performance applying his ideas to the market. This is just fantastic. In 19 86, Barron ran an article, ranking the recent performance of 77 money managers. Claude Shannon, though not mention in the article had done better than all but 3 of the pros, and he's basically doing it his part time. The bear and money managers were mostly firms with up to a hundred people. Shannon worked with his wife and a d intrepid Apple to computer. The 08/11/1986 Barron reported on the recent performance of 1026 mutual funds, Shannon achieved a higher return than 1025 of them. When Warren Buffett bought Berkshire Hathaway 19 65, over 30 years, he had a 20 return of 27 percent. By the late fifties through 19 86, Shannon stock return on his stock portfolio was 28 percent. It's also worth noting it's a little harder to do with larger amounts warren was worrying with larger amounts, but still, Shannon records amazing. Right? Again, this is what I like, well Shannon he he's... He he had an idea and he backed it up. He's like no I think efficient market there is bull wrap and I'm gonna see if I can teach myself how to do this, and he did. Okay. So I wanna... We're almost done, but I wanna, go over this. So this guy few years later, Unfortunately, Claude Shannon went up suffering from alzheimer's alzheimer's disease. So, they're the writing... There's a guy named Hi who was a he was writing an article in Shannon portfolio, but he never published it. But, Shannon wife got a copy, and and gave it to... I think... I don't know if you gave it to this author or somebody. Somehow, the the a william pounds Got his hands on it. This is a draft of Hi article along with Hi recollection, give the most complete view of how Shannon achieved these returns. It had nothing to do with arbitrage. Shannon was a buy and hold fundamental investor. Now here's what Shannon is gonna tell Har. In a way, this is close to some of the work I'd done relating to communication an extraction of signals from noise. He said, Shannon, he said that a smart investor should understand where he has an edge and invest only in those opportunity. Piece. And I know I've said this before, but buffett and among, say the same thing over and over and over again in different ways throughout multiple decades, only invest where you have an edge. Find your edge and invest in it. This is more on how Shannon thought about price and value and the methods he used to invest. In the early 19 sixties, Shannon had played around with technical analysis. He had rejected such such systems. He... This is Shannon talking now. Says I think that the technicians who works so much with price charts and head and shoulders formations and pledging neck lines are working with what I call a very noisy reproduction of the important data. Shannon emphasize. What we can extrapolate about the growth of earnings in the next few years from our evaluation of the company management and the future demand for the company's products, stock prices will in the long run follow earnings growth. Therefore, he paid little attention to price momentum or of volatility. The key data in my view, this is Shannon talking. The key data is, in my view, not how much the stock price changed in the past few days or months. But how the earnings have changed in the past few years. Shannon plotted company earnings on log graph paper and try to draw a trend line into the future. He also tried to surmise while factors might cause the exponential trend to continue or sp out. The Shannon would also visit startup up technology companies and talk with the people running them. Shannon became a board member of Tel. He was not just a distinguished name in the annual port, but was actively scouting potential acquisitions for Ceo, Henry Singleton in other words, he had an edge. He knew. He he knew He had a he had an understanding and access to information that other people did not. And this is also tells you why I'm re... Gonna be reading about Singleton soon, and it's gotta be a podcast you're gonna be able listen to. Warren Buffett himself said the Singleton had the best operating and capital deployment record in American business. It is a... It is at least conceivable that Shannon judgment played a supporting role in his success. And this this next section, but no left myself is this is also why for entrepreneurs that own a profitable private business. It makes sense to do what Warren Buffett device. To treat your business as if it's the only asset your family has had for the next 50 years. If you do that, it causes you to focus, and you're focusing on an area where we have an edge. See how that kind of plays together. Shannon portfolio would have appalled Harry Mark. Marco is the guy that create created Modern portfolio theory, which needless to say people like Buff Mu criticized heavily. I think it's it's t. Alright. So Shannon portfolio would have appalled Harry Mark. By this point, nearly 81 percent of the portfolio was in a single stock tele. The 3 largest holdings consisted of 98 percent of the portfolio. Shannon says, we have not at any time in the past 30 years attempted to balance our portfolio. And what is this echo? This that echoes what Carnegie said? Andrew Carnegie, you told us study how the great fortunes are wealth or, oh, great fortunes are made. It's not a scatter shot approach. It's putting all your eggs in 1 basket and watching that basket, which is what he did with this his steel company. And I'll close on this. This is, the Thor investment record. It says in May 19 98, Thor reported that his investments had grown at an average of 20 percent annual return over 28 years. To help persuade you that this may not be Luck or wrote, I estimate that I have made 80000000000 dollars worth of purchases and sales for my investors. This breaks down into something like 1 and a quarter million individual bets. Averaging 65000 dollars each with an average with on average hundreds of positions in place at any 1 time. Overall, it would seem to be a moderately long run with a high probability that the excess performance is more than chance. And I stop there because that last sentence, I think is what we're all trying to do in our individual lives. We're trying to have an I a high probability of excess performance that's more than chance.

              "transcript": "\nMuch useful thought and data collection has supported the idea that neither securities markets nor betting systems, prevent some ventures from gaining highly satisfactory way above average results through unusual skill. William Pounds book, Fortunes formula collects much of the modern evidence on this point in a highly entertaining way. Moreover the book contains an account of the La Palo investment record of Claude Shannon. Pioneer scientist and information theory that makes Shannon methods look much like those of Charlie Mu. Okay.\n\nSo a few weeks ago when I was reading through Poor Charlie Alma, I came across that paragraph. Charlie Mu is 1 of the smartest people have ever come across. So when he recommends reading a book, it's kind of a no brainer to just order it immediately. So the the the full title of the book is Fortune formula. The untold story of the scientific betting system that beat the casinos and Wall Street and it was written by William Pounds stone.\n\nSo for today, there's a lot of different characters in the book. And I'm gonna focus on 2 of them. Claude Shannon and Ed Edward Do. And both of them also have biographies, which will be featured in the next few weeks on Founder podcast podcasts. Now a note about the format of this podcast.\n\nOkay? Fortune formula is wildly entertaining, but it's written in a very odd and unique way. So some of a lot of the stuff I'm gonna share with you, they're gonna seem like non s. Because I wouldn't describe Fortune formulas as like, a cohesive narrative. It's more like, 30 or 40 individual essays that kind of tie together this theme.\n\nIt ties together ties together this theme that there are people in the world that can actually have better than average performance through unusual skill. And so he... They're they're separated by, like, chapters, but I almost consider them, like essays because some of the chapters, are, like a page, maybe 2 pages, maybe 3 pages. They're very short. So what I did is I just extracted my highlights and notes that I took pertaining to the overall theme of the book, and specifically in the applications of that theme by Claude Shannon and Ed Thor.\n\nAnd I think we're gonna learn a lot But this this story is insane and crazy, and you'll see even more when I cover... I'm gonna cover at Do auto. Next week, it's called a man markets. This guy I an insane life as this claude shannon. Okay.\n\nSo let me go ahead and jump on right in. I'm going to start with Claude Shannon, and I'm gonna go back and forth between Claude shannon and and at Thor. And I... We have to start with understanding, why Claude Shannon is so famous. It's because he invented information theory, which is basically in the foundation of our entire economy in the entire world we live in right now.\n\nAnd then... Specifically how they apply what they learned as academics to investing investments and making a a ton of money. Okay. So it says, life is a gamble. There are sure things.\n\nClaude Shannon was as close to a sure thing as existed. Shannon had done what practically no 1 had done since renaissance. He had single handedly invented an important new science. Shannon information theories an abstract science of communication that lies behind computers, the Internet and all digital media. It is 1 of the few times in history where somebody founded the field, asked all the right questions and answered them at once.\n\nThere were many who compared Shannon insights to Einstein's. Others found that comparison unfair, unfair to Shannon. Einstein's work had virtually no effect on the life of the average human being. The consequences of Shannon work were already being felt in the 19 fifties. In our digital age where...\n\nIf people were asked to characterize Shannon achievements are often a apt to be a loss to be at a loss for words. It's like saying how much influence the inventor of the alphabet has had on literature. Shannon Supreme Opus, information theory turned out to be 1 of those all encompassing ideas. I do agree with Mu when he talks about, like, why he reads many geographies because he says, I think when you were trying to teach the great concepts to work. It helps to tie them into the lives and personalities of the people who develop them.\n\nSo, I've been doing that obviously in the podcast for a long, but I wanna focus a little bit about Shannon or early life and personality. He says, Shannon was born in Michigan in 19 16. He grew up in a town of barely 3000 people. There was inventing in the family blood. Thomas Edison was of distant relation.\n\nShannon grandfather was a farmer and inventor who designed an automatic washing machine. Claude built things with his hands almost comp compulsive from youth to old age. The ability to see clean and elegant solutions to complex problems, distinguish Shannon distinguished with Shannon throughout his life. He, a little bit about his personality. He was a shy, courteous man, seemingly without envy spite our ambition.\n\nHe did his best work alone. He slept when he felt like sleeping and would spent hours at the kitchen table thinking. So when I read that part, I had 2 thoughts. 1, how often does that happen in modern life? Like, how...\n\nLet me ask you the question. Like, how much do you... How much time do you spend just thinking? No input from anybody else but your own mind? And then the second thing I thought of was this this echoes what we learned when we studied Thomas Watson, the founder of Ibm.\n\nAnd Ibm famous for having the the word think as 1 of their company motto. And in his biography, he talks about, like, if he had something he couldn't figure out, he wouldn't go to the office. He would just sit at his kitchen table and think for several hours so he figure it out, and then he would go and go about, like, continuous day. I think they're... That's severely missing from modern life.\n\nI'm speaking my own self too. And something that I think is extremely valuable just dedicating some time to see what your thoughts are actually they are. To download the the the the computation that your brain is doing automatically. I think to do so, you need you know, some empty time where you're not having input from anybody else put your own online. Okay.\n\nContinuing back to Shannon, He would write a eccentric memo to himself. Of the memos is a list of some time passions. This gives you an idea that he was a he was... Some people say, like he was hard to focus. It's not...\n\nI don't... I didn't take that. I I think he just allow... Gave himself the freedom to focus on whatever was most interesting to him at that time. So that the list of some passion, it says it includes chess, uni cycles, juggling, the stock market, gene, running and musical instruments.\n\nSo fast forwarding in his life in 19 36, He got a bachelor of science at the University of In. And the note of myself was here is, like, this guy's obviously genius, and even geniuses, sometimes don't know what they wanna do in life. And right around the time he graduates college, Claude shannon was experiencing the same thing. And he had a rather fort event. He had little notion of what he wanted to do next.\n\nHe happened to see a postcard on the wall saying that the Massachusetts Institute of technology, Mit needed someone to maintain its new computer, the differential analyzer. Shannon applied for the job. So this is a very important point in is life because this is gonna be the beginning of information theory. What Shannon discovers here creates the foundation for our modern life and That's not... That's not the only reason I'm telling this.\n\nIt also creates the foundation for his wild success that he has an investing. He he'll talk about what he learned from developing information theory and how he studied the stock market. They were... I think uses the word like they're almost inseparable. Alright.\n\nSo let's go first to before, he he develops. So he says, Shannon understood that the differential and analyzer was 2 machines and 1. It was a mechanical computer regulated by an electric electrical computer. Remember there's no such really... There's really no such thing as what we feel is the modern computer at this time.\n\nThinking about the machine convince Shannon that electrical circuits could compute more efficiently than mechanical linkage. Shannon envisioned an ideal computer in which numbers would be represented by states of electrical circuits, So he's fan about a world in which we live in right now. There would be nothing to lu in a lot less to break. As an undergraduate, Shannon learn b Algebra on unusual subject for engineers. B Algebra deep deals in the simple notions like true or false and logical relationships such as and or not an if.\n\nAnd why is that important? Because any logical relationship maybe be put together from a combination of these elements. Shannon posed himself the problem of encoding each of these logical ideas in an electrical circuit. To his delight, he succeeded. In effect, so what what was the the result of all this work?\n\nHe proved that an electrical digital computer could compute anything. So I wanna take a small tangent here because there is Cameo for all sorts of historical figures in this book. And I'm only gonna mention a few, but like I said, this is 1 of the most unique books. I can definitely see why Charlie Manga recommends it. And so I wanna...\n\nI think this story about this thing called project x also illustrates, like, Chan was just a very... Like, he was a man of many talents. And what I think he did a good job of is taking all the different experiences and things he learn in life. And combining them together in unique ways later on. So project axis is an example of that.\n\nSo what is project? It says, in the midst of Shannon personal crisis, he was going to divorce its time. He was offered a job at Bell Labs, Shannon accepted, This is a... There was this was the first time he he was offered a job bell labs. People say bell labs because at the time At and t had a majority...\n\nA they call, like, a benign monopoly that that it was, like, it was a place for really smart people to be able to run experiments and never worry about running out of money. Shannon is working there a bunch of other smart people are there, but he accepted the job at this time. He says, once again, Shannon turned his poly morph genius to something completely different. It was called project x, and at the time, it was classified. The only reason we know about it because it was d, like, 2 decades, 3 decades later in 19 76.\n\nSo what was project X. Project x was a joint effort of Bell Labs and Britain's government code in cypher school. It had a scientific pe rival that of the Manhattan project. For the British American team included not only Shannon, but also Alan Turing. So you've probably heard that name before, I'll tell you you'll you'll realize why in case you haven't heard of Alan Turing before why he was important.\n\nI'll get there in 1 second He says, they were building a system known as Sig Sally. And that's an acronym. And that's how Pronounce. I have no idea if that's how it's pronounced. Sixth Alley was the first digitally scrambled wireless phone.\n\nThis was also used during World war 2, which is why the the entire project exists. It says Alan turing cracked the German and N cipher, allowing the allies to ea drop ea drop on the German commands messages, which also led at the point of... Which also led to helping the allies defeat the nazis where we're too. The point of 6 Sally was to ensure that Germans could not do the same. Part of Shannon job was to prove that the system was indeed impossible for anyone lacking a, a key to crack.\n\nShannon and no this is the important part why Bringing this up because it ties to everything else that we're talking about today. Shannon later said that thinking about how to conceal messages with random noise, motivated some of the insights of information theory. So we see this point, and I I just wanna stop here for a second because I see this point over and over and over again when reading biography. There's like, past learnings and experiences. Wind up playing an unexpected role in in in your future.\n\nSo what... The lesson I've learned from all these biographies is like, you need to collect as much of these experiences and learnings as you can because it's unpredictable how you can apply them in the future, and that can open up opportunities that are unavailable to anybody else that did not have that unique set of experiences or learnings. Alright. So back to Shannon. A secrecy a secrecy system is almost identical with a noisy communication system.\n\nHe claimed. The 2 lines of inquiry were so close together that you couldn't separate them. Shannon informed turing that he was working in a way of measuring information. And it's gonna sound familiar to you because it's the world we live in. He call...\n\nHe used a unit called the bit bit was short for binary digit. So I'm gonna... I'll go into more about information theory when I read claude shannon biography in the next few weeks. So 1 thing I do... I'm gonna skip all that part now because I gotta get back to Ed thor and and the the whole point of this book.\n\nBut something I I wanted to bring to point out to you right now is that it was... A lot of people criticize Shannon because, you know, he he started this new field and then kinda just abandoned it. And this is Shannon. There's 2 things that are gonna happen to what I'm about to reach you. Too.\n\nHe he explains why he did that, and also talks about his other varied interest was kind of relate to his first point. Right? Just says Shannon, this is Shannon on his near abandonment of the field he created. And he says, I just developed different interests. As life goes on, you change your direction.\n\nThis is, another insight in my opinion of his personality. He allowed himself to work on and think about whatever that was most interesting to him at that time. Now, what is some... Something else that he was interested and I'm currently going through. So I consider podcasts, especially when you're learning, learning, you're using them for education.\n\nLike, to me, they're just courses. Right? So so founders is just a course in the history of entrepreneurship. Right? And ours, the the the foundation of this course we're using is biographies of entrepreneurs That kinda makes sense.\n\nRight? I'm currently listening to and using Le Friedman course on, our podcasts on artificial intelligence as a course that I'm taking to learn more about artificial intelligence because I... Like, it... It's talked about constantly. It's used...\n\nThey're, like, there's just no, like, concrete definition. There's different, like, a lot of different opinions. So I'm like, okay, I don't know anything about this. So what's sort of a really effective way to learn about it rapidly. And my...\n\nLike, the the outcome of my decision was like, well, let me just listen to and take notes on this this these podcasts. And the foundation of that podcast and that course is just interviews with people working in the field currently. Right? So I'm interested in this because I'm learning about it right now or attempting to learn about, I should say. But what what blew my mind when I read this book is claude shannon was interested in artificial intelligence 63 years ago.\n\nWhich is also why I think it's important to study because a lot of this things people say today are really just things that people are saying 60 years ago. So that's why I was, oh, you know, when anytime you see that, that... That's a good indication that a lot of... There... There's a lot of mimic, not and not as much learning.\n\nAnd so I think, like, I need to dive into that. But anyways, 1 of the interests that pulled Shannon are away from information there is artificial intelligence. And Shannon organized the first major academic conference on the subject in 19 56. Just blew my mind. Alright.\n\nSo now I'm switch back. I'm gonna go back and forth, and I wanna wanna introduce introduce you to Ed Thor. And like I said, next week, I'm currently, I've already started reading his his biography, which is mind blowing, and I'll cover that on next week's podcast. So this is an intro to Ed do, a little bit about his personality and a little bit about his early life. Alright.\n\nSo let's go to the book. 1 friend described Ed do as the most precise man I've ever met. The z for measurement was evident from his earliest use. Ed did not utter his first words until he was nearly 3. From that moment on, Ed converse almost like an adult.\n\nSo the first time his parents heard him speak was in a complete sentence, so it's kind of mind blowing. So says, from that point, forward, he converts like an adult. 6 months after that, after his for sentence, Ed knew had to count to a million. He could read and had a near photographic memory. Growing up in hard times, Ed turned his wits to making money.\n\nHe bet a grocer he could total customers bills in his head faster than the grocer could use... Could using an adding machine. Ed 1, earning ice cream cones for his performance. While both parents were working, Ed and his younger brother were latch key kids. The absence of parental supervision facilitated an interest in blowing things up.\n\nEd Whacked, homemade Nit Not sure if that's how he pronounce it. With a sled hammer to blow holes in the sidewalk. He built pipe bombs to blow craters into cliffs. He built a gunpowder propelled rocket car, interesting enough in his in his biography, he calls himself a mis fit, which I love. In spring 19 55, Thor was a physics undergraduate student at Ucla.\n\nHe may do on a budget of a hundred dollars a month. His rent was 50 dollars a month plus 4 hours of work per week. Since time was money, Thor put in 50 to 60 hours a week of classes and study. He read books on psychology for tips on how to learn faster. So this is actually 1 of the I've been not only reading his biography Would have watched and taken notes on.\n\nI don't know, like 3 or 4 of his talks. And they're on Youtube. And this is something I learned from at Thor. He was fascinated with increasing a skill per hour. I've never thought about before.\n\nSo he wanted, like, for his example, for example, he wanted to optimize things, like, how fast he could learn something per hour or how much money he could make per hour. Not just like, I'm not talking about oh, this is, like, the salary offering from. Literally taking how much money he tries to make it, like, in Las Vegas and and dividing it on like, a per hour basis. That's a really unique idea that I wanna I wanna, like, maintain in my own mind and kinda, like a adopt to my own life. Like, what's the the fastest I can do something and still get all, like the result I want from it.\n\nI think it's very... It's it's applicable to almost anything. Alright. So it's a grad student physics grad student, and they're at a party and they're you start having a conversation. And this is where Ed gets interested in trying to use math and physics to beat Las Vegas.\n\nAnd again, I have to set the foundation because the same ideas that he learns here, he applies to investing later on. Alright. So the conversation turned to ways to ways to make easy money. Someone mentioned Ro, the group was unanimous in the conviction that gambling systems are worthless, meaning, way, like, there's no point trying to figure out a way to beat them. To be beat, like, a a Las Vegas game.\n\nThe discussion had to do a physics. Are Ro let wheels so perfect that predicting likely numbers is impossible. Thor and most of them arrive at conclusion that, yes. That that was the case. Thor had the most original argument.\n\nHe said you can make money either way. If the wheels are physically perfect, simple physics can predict where the ball is going to go. If the wheels have flaws, some of the numbers ought to be favored. So he decides to try to solve this impossible... What quote unquote impossible problem.\n\nAnd this is interesting That he says that you can make money either way because he's famous for... He's like the father of Quan, 1 of the first people to to to start a quantitative hedge fund. And he calls his hedge fund a market new market neutral hedge fund. She kinda echo echoes, like, what are he's saying here about about Ra that like, you could figure out how to make money in in any environment. So while he's studying, he's trying to figure out how he can apply physics and math to beating ro, but while studying Ro, he comes across a paper that studies the odds of blackjack.\n\nHe's like, oh, that's interesting. Like, I won't need because he needs a, like, a, machine. He why building, like, 1 of the first like portable computer devices, and he builds it to try to beat let. But he says, hey, I could start studying to see if I can figure out a system to beat blackjack too. So it says, until the compute, and this this thought he has is gonna lead his life into intersect with Claude Shannon.\n\nSo it says until the computer age was impractical... Impractical to calculate the exact probabilities in Blackjack and many other card games. After a couple weeks he concluded that the problem was too big to solve by hand. Then he realized that he might be able to do the computations on Mit mainframe computer. It was an Ibm 07:04, a real programmable goal pro programmable electronic computer.\n\nIt had some free time during the summer summer break, meaning, remember these were all shared. Like, you had a book time on it. Thor, So he's said like, okay. I'll use that, but he didn't know how to use a computer. So he had he first teach himself as a program.\n\nSo says Thor taught himself the 4 tran programming language and programmed the computer himself. Thor decided to publish his system. Okay? So he wants to write a paper. He wants to have it published by other academics, but there's problem.\n\nAnd this is where Thor and Shannon are gonna meet. Articles had to be submitted by a national academy member, and there was only 1 academy member at Mit. Who was a mathematician. That was a famous claude Shannon. So were past the point where Shannon already invented information theory He's obviously famous at this time he's working on other things.\n\nSo his thor called Shannon secretary and made an appointment to meet him. Before Thor went in, the secretary warned him that Shannon had only a few minutes to spare. He did not spend time on subjects that did not interest him. And so Shannon Thor tells him about his paper on blackjack, Shannon and Thor are about to agree to work together. So Shannon agrees to submit the paper on Blackjack.\n\nAre you working on anything else in the gambling air area, Shannon asked. Thor told Shannon about the Ro idea? Shannon was r. He was possibly more interested in the Ro gillette scheme than the black Blackjack system because there was a gadget to build. They spoke for several hours.\n\nBy the time they adjourned, Thor had inadvertently set 1 of the century greatest minds on yet another tangent. It was agreed that Shannon and Thor would collaborate on building a ro prediction machine. But let me back up What a great sentence. Thor inadvertently set 1 of the century great minds on yet another tangent. Shannon said the best place to work would be his home.\n\nThe device they built was a size of a cigarette pack. It contained 12 transistors and slipped into a pocket. The user needed to measure the initial position and velocity of the 2 moving objects and in the case of Ro that was the ball on the rotor. It says to do that, the user mentally picked a reference point. When a point on the rotor passed this reference point, the user clicked a tow operated switch concealed in his shoe.\n\nSo this is like some oceans 11 stuff. I mean, it it's pretty crazy. They actually go to Vegas and test this out. And it's bananas. From this data, the device predicted, the segment of the wheel in which the ball was most likely to land, hence where you should be betting.\n\nRight? Now this next section is gonna give you an insight and into how their minds worked, and the level of thought that they put into this. So it says the Gillette computer was finished by late spring 19 61. In a dry run lasting a few hours, Shannon and Thor multiplied a virtual bank role of a few hundred into an impressive though fictional 24000 dollars. Thor did a full dress rehearsal and Shannon workshop.\n\nThey used the finest wire practical barely as thick as a hair to connect the earphone to the pocket unit because it's gonna play a series of note musical notes in in thor ear, and each note corresponds with a a place on the the ro wheel. And thor then knows where to to to bet. Where's the most likely part where the ball's is gonna land. It says, the wire was glued to his skin with gum, then the wires were painted to match thor skin and hair. So they take this machine to Vegas.\n\nAnd keep in mind, this was really fascinating. Now because of the work of Thor and Shannon, there's actually laws past in the eighties by congress to outlaw what they're doing. But at this time, using your advice to predict Ro was perfectly illegal. Now it's legal, but part of the... A large part of this book is that a lot of these betting systems that people are trying to to to to beat or you're not only like they're gangster and mobs and thugs that are trying to do this, but also the people that own the casinos are also extremely violent people, which will get to in a minute.\n\nSo it says, but the group knew well even though it's legal, the new well aware that the casino people would take a dim view on their experience are in their experiment. Unlike the Blackjack system, this scheme use a device, meaning the Blackjack system, they they... Event... Like, there's no way they could prove that you're counting cards. Right?\n\nThey'll just kick you out of the casino, which they do do do later. But with the system, like, you can't hide a device. If they capture you and search you, they're gonna find it. So there was no denial ability. Claude stood by the wheel and recorder the numbers that came up on a piece of paper.\n\nThis was a smokes screen. Claude was really timing the ball and rotor with his toe switches. So he's got switches in his feet that correspond and play that that musical note in Thor ear. The computer relayed its musical tone prediction to the better, who pretended not to know claude. The thin here's the problem I ran into.\n\nThe thin wires kept breaking. Every time that happened, they had to go back to their rooms for repair. They brought so sold our iron sold irons with them. These problems prevented any serious gambling, so it was actually unsuccessful. The collaboration between Shannon and Thor ended with this Las Vegas trip.\n\nThat same month, Thor got a job offer from the Mathematics department of of New Mexico State University. So we wanted have having to move across the country. So around this time, Thor like, well, I can I just spoke on my blackjack area because I then I have to worry about a machine? It's just... It's a lot easier.\n\nI could just do the math of my head. He's the 1 that kinda that him... That is credited for inventing card counting. He wrote a best selling book called Beat the dealer. That's back in the sixties that that sold well over a million copies.\n\nAlright. So this is where Thor gets the idea. Like, let me test my blackjack there, but I'm broke. I don't have any money. So, he's at a conference.\n\nIs Ed thor sending a version of the paper Shannon submitted to the National Academy. Thor titled it Fortune formula. A winning strategy for blackjack. Now you see where the where the author pound stone got his idea for his title of his book. And so he makes this this speech, it gets a lot of attention.\n\nHe says Ed to decides to test his stereo in a casino. He needs someone to bankrupt him. Now this is where I left a note to myself. What's fascinating to me is Ed becomes an unbelievably wealthy man. Right?\n\nBut at this time, he doesn't even have any money. He's just an academic. He's not doing that well. He got a little bit of money from from like, in advance of the book or from some royalty of the book. It winds up selling a over a million copies like, years later.\n\nIt's probably at the time, but if people still buy to this days at my point. And what I found fascinating at this point is, I just told you, like, he he becomes 1 of the most successful investors ever. Right? He was 32 years old before he haven't he ever thought about finance. To me that's knowing that is like, really inspiring.\n\nAnd why is that inspiring? Because he... Wants to become 1 of the most successful small invisible of all time and he gets... Well, many people would consider, like, a later start in life. So anyways, as a result of this...\n\nAs a speech, gambler from all over the country began calling Thor hotel to ask for copies of his paper. Someone to finance thor in the casinos for a share of the profit. Thor wanted to accept 1 of the offers. It would be fun to try the Blackjack system out in a real casino. Thor discussed the situation with Shannon.\n\nNow this is another very important point of this entire book. Shannon suggested that Thor used Kelly's formula to decide how much to bet. So another person that worked at at Bell Labs was his guy named John Kelly. And he's most famous for creating something called the Kelly formula called Kelly Criterion, it has a bunch of names. Right?\n\nBut this is something that let me just... It's a mathematical form equation. Right? And I'm obviously not gonna explain that on the podcast. And to be frank, there's no way Even understand it.\n\nBut the core of John Kelly's philosophy of risk can be stated without math. And it's as follows. It is that even unlikely events must come to pass eventually. Therefore, anyone who accepts small risks of losing everything will lose everything sooner or later. This is important for investors, entrepreneurs for everybody in life.\n\nThe ultimate compound return rate is acutely sensitive to fat tails, Fat tails is just another way to to state on unlikely events. Okay. So Shannon, Thor. It's rumored Buffett, Mu, a bunch of other people, Mark Sp na, who, I did on Pakistan on the Dallas Capital. They all use and or know about Kelly's criterion.\n\nThere's also book, Thor wrote about it. If you wanted to learn more, or you could just read the wikipedia page, but it also... I I think Gonna order the book is fascinating. But it's extremely important part of the entire book because the reason this book is important is because it's essentially like a book about the difference between entrepreneurs and academics. And the people that practice and live in the real world, entrepreneurship, are the people that live in, like fantasy Land in theory, academics.\n\nRight? And so on 1 side, in this book you have Shannon Mu, Buffett, thor. And they're saying the idea like, yes, you can you can gain an unusual advantage in life through unusual skill. On the other side you have people like Paul Samuel and other economist and academics are saying, no. The...\n\nThe market is perfectly efficient. No 1 can make more money, like you're an idiot for trying. Right? And what the entrepreneurs, and it's really important how you apply to your own life is they... The reason that Buffett and Shannon and all these people wanna being successful because they understood the Kelly formula, the Kelly criterion on.\n\nThe fact that you are a fool if you accept any risk. However small you think it is of losing everything. And I'm gonna tell you later on a lot of the academics that criticize thor and Buffett and the rest these guys. Why starting a hedge fund, long term capital management, which is famous and not understanding the California formula, and blowing up and needing to be bailed out by the Us treasury. So that, I'm not really ruining the point of this podcast, but I think understanding that now is gonna, it makes sense why I'm tying all these these things that seem to be unrelated together.\n\nThat is a huge important part of understanding, like, what we're all trying to learn here. That you are... It is unacceptable to accept even a tiny tiny, tiny risk of losing everything. To be a successful entrepreneur, you have to first survive. If your business blows up, you're done.\n\nYou're out of the game. That's that's... So that's of course, the very first thing that you should avoid. That's what Shannon avoiding with do avoiding, and see how they're that... This is what's fascinating to me.\n\nThey're applying this to blackjack years before they apply to the stock market. So it's that same what I mentioned earlier how you need to collect all these learnings experiences in your life, because you never know what you could apply to later. This idea they were just tinkering around with casino and, casino games, winds up making them wealthy. Shannon Shannon point like less wealthy, because it he has a a fantastic rate of return, but he also... Didn't really care about, like, accumulating wealth.\n\nHe had a very. So anyways, I'll get there. Alright. So it says, Thor decided that the best offer was the biggest 1. A syndicate of 2 Wealthy New Yorkers was offering a hundred thousand dollars.\n\nNow this is... Would be over a million dollars today. To take on the Nevada casinos. Thor dialed the number on the letter and asked to speak to a manual kim. So this is the the only part of the podcast where we're gonna get into like, all these underworld figures because it's fascinating.\n\nAnd if you're interested in that kind of stuff. I would recommend reading the book. Again, don't even listen to me. Charlie Mu how to read it, you should probably read it. So this is an intro to Manny Kim, and emmanuel Kim known as Man Kim.\n\nAnd I'm gonna... He's also tied to this other gangster, I, literally, these are Mafia guys. This a wi. I don't know how to pronounce his name, but there's a reason I'm bringing that up. I'm not just doing it because I I found it entertaining.\n\nAlright. So first, let's let's talk about Manny, because to understand Thor, and the wild crazy life he has. You have to understand some of the people he associated with. He didn't know they were mafia. Like, he he was kind of...\n\nHe found out later and then he he stopped associating with them, obviously. But he was very much, you know, the land of horse betting and casinos and and marketing manipulation, also they're kinda of crazy stuff is, you know, there's gonna be a lot of you know, organized crime in it. Alright. So Manny Kim. He would...\n\nMan would bid on anything at any time, as long as the odds were to his liking. Kim will taught himself calculus tri and probability theory or at Least he said he had, and I don't know if he ever did. Within his brain was a combination of street smarts and auto diet book learning that could swiftly analyze propositions. He was, you know, rather smart though. I just don't know if he knew all the other stuff.\n\nHe memorized I sucker bets. 1 of his favorite 1 of his favorites was betting that 2 people in a group would have the same birthday. Kim victims would take even money. Kim knew he had an edge whenever there were more than 22 people. Kim edge was not always strictly mathematical and not always strictly ethical.\n\nSo let me go back to Thor and Kim. Kim appeared to be interested only inviting out whether Thor system worked. He he showed no interest in paper. And as far as thor could tell, the math greek to Kim. Kim demanded that they play each other.\n\nThor flew New York each Wednesday to play cards against Kim. He won regularly, convincing Kim was playing skills in the merit of the accounting system. Kim occasionally presented Thor with a gift of a salami. I just included that. Because when I read it, we made me laugh.\n\nLike, alright? Thanks for beating me, Salami. Alright. Now to this is a... The...\n\nAnother... I keep saying this how how many crazy surprising things are on in this book, but this is 1 of really crazy 1? So Kim is involved with this guy named Sw. And he is definitely a mafia guy. And the reason I put this in the story is because Thor is gonna run into some of these people.\n\nAnd I think just something you should learn in life that thing is obvious like, there are some people in life that you should just not mess with. And I always go back to, like, that book I did on Ko Van belt where, yeah, he's a businessman man he's an entrepreneur Yeah he's the wealthiest person in the world of time, but he also will will break the law and try to have you killed if you go against him. If you remember what he did to in the book, the Ty war when when, somebody thought they had a good idea of con some of the ships. He went and sent, like, Assassins and mercenaries and other countries armies after them. So you just have to understand it in life, like, there's just certain people that don't care about rules.\n\nAnd if you mess with them, like you could have consequences, which is what makes with thor is doing right now extremely dangerous. And this is an example of somebody, this... I'm gonna call Wi because it's ZWI. We're gonna call Wi. Wi is he he has a a racket, a numbers racket, which is a way for people to gamble, which is very popular at the time for for the way, certain mafia figures make money.\n\nSo it says a minor thug named Leo began rough up Wi numbers runners. He was given a warning. Leo responded that he'd kicked woman in the balls to teach him a lesson. Wi insisted on handling this insult personally. He tracked Leo to a bar to a bar and shot him once in the testicles.\n\nSo woman has all these other... Like, he's extremely wealthy. He made money, like, off prohibition running running a legal liquor into the United States. He's a bunch of gambling businesses. He owns like, part part owner in, like, bunch of parking lots, like all kinds of stuff.\n\nSo something happens where Woman dies. And it looks like he committed to his suicide most likely he was murdered by other mafia members. Okay? Now the reason I'm bringing this up is because when Woman dies, Man is then, he's he benefits from woman's death, Well, let me treat it. Woman's death left Manny Kim will holding a portfolio of businesses, Okay?\n\nSome legitimate and some not. Some owned by Kim and others apparently in partnership with Woman's estate and other Murky entities. Wi had an idea for par laying this wealth. That idea was to try to beat to gamble and not only the the the the Las Vegas casinos, but also the stock market. Now the reason I bring this up is because this is 1 of the most surprising facts in the book is that the businesses that Wi and Manny own together it starts out, like really successful.\n\nThey own, like, 60 something parking lots in in in New York city, and I think they... The revenue on the parking lot something like, a million over a million and a half dollars a day or something like that. And 1 of the strangest twists in life, that business winds up becoming warner communications, which is today known as warner media, which is a huge media conglomerate. That thing just blew my mind, how how, like, these these things could start it's so unrelated and and over time morph into something like unpredictable. Okay.\n\nSo back to to Manny, that's the end of Woman in the story. Let's go back to Manny and Thor. So they go to Vegas. Kim will pulled out a water of bills and count out 10000 dollars for Thor. Thor started gambling.\n\nThey won 500 dollars and 15 minutes, and then the dealer press the second the secret button on the floor. So I'm just skip over more major parts of the book, but what's happening here is they don't care if they can prove your counting cards or if you have a system for being blackjack. When you're too successful, especially at this time, they immediately start cheating or kicking out a casino or in some cases, trying to kill you. So, eventually, they're all identified... They're identified at all the casinos to go to.\n\nSo they walk in a casino and they're immediately like, pushed out. So they're may... They they make money though. And again, man wanted to start with a hundred thousand dollars. Thor was the 1 that brought it down to 10.\n\nRight? You can imagine how much money they would have made if they would started with a hundred thousand dollars. But this is so once they become too well known in Vegas, it terminate their experiment. Now here's a result of that. By Thor, they had built 10000 dollars into 21000 dollars in about in about 30 per...\n\nIn 30 hours of play. Head and that was after Kim wasn't listening the Thor and wind up burning through 11000 dollars. Like, he didn't know what he was doing. So essentially, it should have been 32000 dollars, but it was... They made 20...\n\nThey made 11000 dollars So says, this is how profitable per... And this is how 4 thinks about it. He breaks it down profitable per hour. Thor system, 11000 dollars, profit in 30 hours. It's 366 dollars per hour playing blackjack.\n\nIf if man didn't mess it up, they would have made 733 dollars. Per hour. So it's itself safe to say that that that Ed has thrown a way to indeed beat the dealer. And now is a system effective, but he's also using the Kelly system Kelly Criterion to figure out how much bet I wanna talk you a little bit more about that real quick. And again, it's it's it's just states that even in unlikely events must come to pass eventually.\n\nSo it says given a favorable betting opportunity. The Kelly system promises maximum profit and protection against ruin. The reason I think it's important because according to ed thor and others, this is the single best system to build wealth. Okay? Alright.\n\nSo given a favorable betting opportunity, The Kelly system promises maximum profit and production against your ruin. These go goals may sound anti hypothetical. It is worth note looking at how the Kelly formula works in a casino situation. The Kelly system avoids gambler ruin quite simply. It is a proportional betting system.\n\nThat means that each wage scale to the current size of the bank role. Since you bet only a prescribed fraction of what you currently got, you can never run out of money. When you lose repeatedly as will happen in any game of chance, bet scaled down in proportion to your diminished wealth. The exponential growth of wealth in the Kelly system is also a consequence of proportional betting. As the bank roll grows, you make larger bets.\n\nAssuming you have an edge and that is the biggest biggest biggest part, 1 of the biggest parts. Maybe, no, let me say it's the biggest part. Assuming you have an edge. In the long run, you will win more than you lose. This is important to investors.\n\nIt's important to entrepreneurs. There's no point in starting a business if you don't feel you have an edge. Buffett, Mu, Thor and Shannon All agree. If you don't have an edge, you don't bet and you don't compete. Now, what's so special about the specific system that Kelly devised?\n\nThe answer is simply that the Kelly system grows wealth faster than any other. Alright. So let's go back to Ed do. At this point, it's it's funny to me because if you really think about the life story of Ed Do. He's a kid that's born poor, and yet he goes on to learn and build more wealth than he could ever spent.\n\nAnd the reason he he moves across the country starts working with Shannon is because he needed the money. New Mexico state offered a salary of about 50 percent more than Thor making. Living cost would be much less as well. The money weighed heavily on Thor as he and his wife were now raising a family. So Thor accepts the offer.\n\nThor writes a best bestselling book called Beat the dealer, and then he starts using his count... Counting system to make some side money. So now he's going to other... Now he's on his own. He's not with Manning, and all these other Mafia guys.\n\nHe obviously realizes they're in a mafia by now. So as doing some press for beat the dealer, he gets profile by a magazine, and it says, the 19 66 magazine profile and Thor contained probably the first mention of the Kelly system in a general publication. And he says, 1 of the most ingenious aspects of thor strategy today involves his application of the Kelly system. A mathematical theory for the management of capital conceived by Bell Bell Labs research scientist. That's John Kelly I mentioned earlier.\n\nIt is this element of play which ensures him against going broke. The man or woman who constantly over bets even in favorable situation is certain to do so. So this is the problem though. He's drawing a lot of attention to himself. So even if they don't...\n\nThey... They're not recognizing him because he's walked into their casino before, he starts... They... People obviously in their gambling and to share gonna hear about his book. And so even though Thor is playing on his own, the casinos fight back.\n\nAnd this is what I mentioned earlier. Like, there's no rule in life that's saying that other humans are gonna play by the rules. And if you don't understand that, you could put yourself in a very dangerous situation, and Ed almost died doing so. Says, no interference from casinos was becoming unrealistic assumption. While playing at 1 casino Thor was offered to drink.\n\nAfter drinking it, he noticed he had problems concentrating. Thor staggered up from the table and got to his room. His eyes were dilate. It took about 8 hours for the effect to wear off. I know of 3 beating store said.\n\n1 was a well known blackjack card counter, and he had his... And he had a lot of his face caved in. A guy, another guy I know had his arms held and every time he try to catch his breath, they'd punch him in the solar plexus. So he's like, this is stupid. I...\n\nI'm gotta find a different way to do this. And he realizes, This is where Shannon and thor started applying what they learned from gambling to the stock market. And they believe that the idea that markets are perfectly efficient to be false. Again, I I've kind of talked about this a lot of a past few because Buffet mentions it over and over again to shareholders letters, mon talks about it, and we'll we'll get into here. I says, I'd be a bum in the street with a 10 cup.\n\nIf the markets were efficient, warren Buffett once. Warren Buffett once said. Buffet had already made a name for himself with a successful hedge fund, and it had founded Berkshire Hathaway. When Paul Samuel, this is the guy that's popular that popularized efficient market theory wrote that a loose version of the efficient market a random walk hypothesis accord with the facts of life. The truth is this is Paul Samuel still talking.\n\nThe truth is, and that's that's this is what he thinks. He says this truth it must be emphasized, is a truth about New York, Chicago and Omaha. His Samuel was apparently felt that Buffett success was best filed with a small minority of unexplained cases. So this is my problem with Paul Hamilton is he had, like, the book says it had spirited advocacy for the efficient market hypothesis the Swiss swept the academic community in 19 sixties and seventies. He went winning a nobel prize for this theory.\n\nMy problem is Samuel was a liar. Because he's he's talking about, oh, he... He's a very common condescending to people that don't agree with it. He calls them fools and everything else. And yet, he's...\n\nSo he's talking about, like, this is stupid. Like, you're dumb for believing this and he he's preaching that you should just, you know, just... You shouldn't even try. And but so that's what he's saying with his mouth. But what is he doing with his actions?\n\nHe's buying Berkshire Hathaway stock. So that tells you he doesn't believe what he's saying. Buffet met... It was just interesting to me when I was reading a shareholder letters. Buffet kept mentioning a person who popularized Emt, which is fisher market dairy.\n\nBut who's also a berkshire investor. It wasn't until I read Fortunes formula that I knew he was referring to. And so that's that... That's something III, like, I hold Dear in my life and something that has help helped me is, like, I try not to pay attention what people say. I try to pay attention to what they do.\n\nI think our actions reveal... Like, the... It's it's a difference between, like, revealed preference to stated preference. Like, you just watch what they do. And you'll see what they actually believe in.\n\nAnd so in his case, like, he obviously didn't believe that, because if he wouldn't think he could make above market average above average market returns by investing in a single stock, which is what he was doing. I don't I... I hate people like that. It it bothers me. It's like they're...\n\nIII consider it lying. Alright. So let's go back to S So in late 19 50, Shannon began an intensive study of the stock market that was motivated both by intellectual curiosity and a desire for gain. He filled 3 library shells with something like a hundred books on economics and investing. At the time he was designing the Rule computer with Thor, Shannon kept notes in an Mit notebook.\n\nPart of the notebook is devoted to a wildly disconnected set of stock market mu. Shannon wanted about the statistical structure of the markets random walk, whether information theory could provide useful insights. This is how he's supplying something he learned 2 decades prior or decade and a half earlier to what he's doing now. He considered margin trading and short selling. Stop loss orders and the effects of market panic.\n\nCapital gain taxes and transaction costs. He notes of such success stories as the Lone Wolf who ran about 10000 dollars into a million into about in in 10 years, and He Green, the witch of Wall Street, who ran a million into a hundred million in 30 years. This is shannon specifically in the efficient market theory. You know the economist talk about the efficient market where everything is equal out, and nobody can make any money. Really, it's all lock and so on, Shannon 1 said, I don't believe that's true at all.\n\nSo Shannon starts to make a lot of money in the stock market, and that we're gonna be introduced to another person who also is who... We... We've also... You might have heard the name from Charlie Mu and Warren Buffett, and that that person's Henry Singleton, who I'm also reading a book about and will appear on a future founders episode. Says in 19 54 Charles Harrison, a bell lab scientist, Shannon New started his own company.\n\nHarrison laboratories made power supplies for the promising new field of color television. Shannon bought a block of stock. Harrison labs is not a familiar name today because it was acquired by Hp back in 19 62. The stocks price zoomed and Shannon got a handsome chunk of he packard stock in the merger. The size of the paper profit convinced him there was real money to be made in stocks.\n\nSo he continues the experience with Harrison made Shannon receptive when another friend Henry Singleton spoke of starting his own company. By 19 60, Singleton founded Tele, a defense contractor selling digital navigation systems to the Pentagon. Shannon brought a couple thousand shares at the initial price of a dollar a share. By 19 67, it hit 24 dollars a share. As the company shares Skyrocketed, Singleton used that inflated market value to buy other companies.\n\nHe bought about a hundred and 30. Tele came to down insurance companies, offshore oil wells, and the manufacturer of the water pick teeth cleaners. So I think Buffett, he says something like Singleton is the single best all of capital in history. And once I heard that, I was like, okay. Well, I got...\n\nI definitely have to read about this person he sounds fascinating. Alright. At Thor starts investing stocks and why does he do that? He says, I realized that if I pushed it sooner or later, some unpleasant physical things would happen in Nevada. He decided to direct his talents toward the biggest casino of all, the stock market.\n\nSo he starts out, but he doesn't really know too much about investing. And he loses a large percentage of a little money. He has speculating on silver, and he learns a very valuable lesson. It kinda ties into buffet Buffett ideas, and among others, about never betting or investing your time or money in an area where you have no edge. So Thor says, I learned an expensive lesson read it regarding all the money lost and Silver.\n\nAnd he says the lesson was you were unlikely to get an edge out of what you see in the news. So Thor decides hey, I gotta look where grab an edge. He has some unique insights on options and warrants. And at this point in his life, Ed thor is gonna move to Southern California, and he's gonna start his work on options. He switches schools to uc Uc Irvine.\n\nOfficer just says, summer 19 64 brought changes in Thor life. The grant supporting his appointment at New Mexico state had worn out. On T first day at Uc Irvine, he had happened to mention his interest in warrants to Julian Feldman, the head of the computer sciences department. Oh, Feldman said, we've got a guy who's doing the same thing. He was talking about the economist named Sheen Cass.\n\nFeldman introduced Thor to Ka, and they resolved do a weekly research seminar in the subject. But there were no students. Thor and Cass off simply met weekly to figure out how to get rich Thor began trading warrants. His hedging system, and he calls this the delta hedging system. And his hedging system hoped or said his hedging system worked as he had hoped by 19 67, Thor had par his original 40000 dollars into a hundred thousand dollars.\n\nSo thor writes a letter Shannon, and he tells him. He's like, listen, after several 4 starts, I have finally hit paid dirt with the stock market. I have constructed a complete math mathematical model for a small section of the market. A major portion of my modest resources has been invested for several months. We said a tentative first goal of doubling the capital every 2 years.\n\nIt isn't far away now. So Thor wanted up being successful. He wanted wanting to run money for other for other people for outside investors, so he writes a book, publishing his system. And then he's looking for partners. And you have to pick, lesson.\n\nIs you have to pick the right business partners. And the reason Thor doesn't pick Cass off because there's a philosophical difference. So it says, Cass believed that he could sometimes predict in which directed direction certain stocks were going to move. Cass was willing to buy stocks. He thought were going up and sell short stocks he thought were going down.\n\nThor wasn't. He was un that Cass off or anyone could predict the market that way. So he winds up the annoyed left myself is Store finds the right partner and starts a hedge fund. I find out later on that. That might...\n\nI've been in the case. He definitely started a hedge fund, not sure he's he found the right partner. But now this is gonna... This is the beginning of 1 of the most full hedge funds of all time, and it's called Princeton Newport and Thor finds this guy named Reagan Reagan. And Thor lives in California Reagan lives on the East Coast, and it what what blew my mind is Thor starts working remotely.\n\nAnd this is I think back in... Inserting back in the sixties. Alright. So this is Thor talking. He says, Re Reagan was a natural promoter and extra bird.\n\nHe was gonna have... He was going to do the things I didn't want to do, which were, like, interface with brokers, accounting, run around Wall Street getting information that sort of thing. What I wanted to do was think, workout theories and try to put them into action. We were actually happy being separate because we had different styles and very different personalities. Being separate was 1 of the odd parts of this arrangement.\n\nSo the time about the fact that this this is a remote company. Thor did not wanna give up his Uc Irvine post our California. It's kinda crazy that he he's running 1 of the most hedge funds, and then he finally quits years later, but It's kinda shows you how cautious he is. It was agreed from the outset that would be a bi partnership connected by a wire, a wire of phone and data lines. Thor and a staff would do the math in California.\n\nAnd they would transmit trade instructions to Regan to... Yeah, to reagan and staff on the East Coast. The East Coast branch would handle the business and of things, including most of the recruitment of investors. Now along this time, Thor is trying to get people invested with him, 1 of them is a dean at you seen Irvine, and this is where what leads him to meet a young warren buffett. This is still in the 60.\n\nSo they're probably in the thirties. They're, like, let's say late thirties maybe at this time. Says before committing any money to Thor, this guy's name's Gerard. Gerard wanted his money manager to meet Thor and size him up. The manager was warren Buffett.\n\nThor and wife, Thor and his wife met Buffett and his wife for a night of bridge. Thor was impressed with Buffett breath of interests. He believed that Buffett will 1 day become the richest man in America. Buffett verdict on Thor was also positive. Gerard who had done quite well with Buffett decided to invest with Thor.\n\nAnd so they're kind of bonding over the fact that their Thor Shannon and Buffett, they're the direct opposite of this idea that the market is efficient And Thor says, the question wasn't is the market efficient, but rather how inefficient is the market and how can we exploit this? So Thor approach is completely different than others this at this time. And anytime you're gonna do anything different, you can be be expected to be criticizing me told they are wrong. So now as he applying math, but he's using computers. And so the Wall Street Journal does a story on Thor and his new Princeton newport hedge fund.\n\nAnd, the journal... It says the journal writer was a maze that Thor disregard a fundamental analysis and his reliance on computers. In 19 74, the journal average reader had as much hands on experience with computers as with moon rockets. The whole computer model bit is ridiculous because the real investment world is too complicated to be reduced to a model, an unnamed mutual fund manager was quoted as saying, you can't replace the money manager using security analysis and market feel with a machine. Yet the journal reported that T machine, outperformed all but 1 of the 400 mutual funds tracked.\n\nIs this thor on it. The... On the 1 that beat. He says the better 1 was 1 of those crazy funds that invested only in gold stocks. And so let I'm me gonna just fast forward it a little bit here.\n\nNow this is the update on the progress of Thor first company. I just wanted you to notice that I said first company. At at fiscal, at as at the year end of 19 82, Thor and Reagan could boast at a dollar invested at the outset had grown to 6 dollars and 61 cents in 13 years. By that time, Thor and Reagan had turned a conviction that the market can be beaten into 1 of the most successful in investment partnerships of all time. It was rare enough to cheat to achieve greater than market return over 13...\n\nConsecutive years. Skeptical academics and some traders tended to judge such exceptional performance as a fo bargain. They said sooner or later, they were gonna lose big. Thor remember, but what's gonna prevent them from losing bit. Pick the Kelly Criterion.\n\nRight? Thor was intros, approaching the challenges of his work as a scientist. I think this is also a smart way for entrepreneurs to do so. He measured his words like he measured everything else. Thor was careful to characterize his son's for his funds performance as getting rich slowly.\n\nSo what I mean about approaching things as a scientist. Is like, he has a theory, then he needs he needs to test that theory in the world world. And as a result of testing your theories in the world, you're gonna get unexpected results. That's what I meant about that. Okay.\n\nNot so it it took him until 19 82 until he quit his day job teaching at you see Irvine. So that's pretty crazy. That's what. Close to 15 years. Thor was slow to display his now considerable wealth.\n\nIn the office, he dressed like a California professor on his day off in shirts and sandals. When the thor finally decided it was time to buy a big house, they chose a hillside 10 bathroom home, said to be the largest in newport beach. Kinda gives you an idea of how he's doing? I've seen interview interviews. He won't tell how much money he's made?\n\nIt had it had a fallout shelter with 16 inch thick concrete walls and steel doors. And why do I bring that? Like, why am I including that part in the podcast. Not just talk about big houses. Is because it gives you insight into his mind.\n\nEver mindful of the odds, Thor computed that it could withstand a 1 mega mega ton hydrogen bomb blast as close as a mile away. Neither Thor Nor Reagan could have imagined how soon it would all end or how, and there's gonna be another... I... Feel like I keep saying that over and over again, but there's another insane story in the book, how their hedge headphone winds up coming to an end. So there's this illustration I really like and it tell...\n\nIt will tell you how the proponents of the Kelly side are thinking about things. So I'm gonna read it to you. The growth of dollars under our various money management schemes may be compared objectively, like the growth of bacteria and petri dishes. K? So just think about it as a money management system.\n\nThe dollar subjected to the Kelly system survive and grow faster than those subjected to any other system. The experiment can be repeated as many times as it takes to convince the skeptic. And then you ask which system would you prefer for your money? An asset test of Princeton and Newport market in neutrality came in a black... In the form of the black Monday crash in 10/19/1987.\n\nThe Dow Jones lost 23 percent of its value in a single day. The biggest single day drop ever. Princeton Newport 600000000 dollar portfolio shed only about 2000000 dollars in the crash. Do computer immediately began alerting him to rich opportunities in the panic valuations. Princeton Newport closed October 19 87 just about even for the month.\n\nMost mutual funds were down 20 percent or more. Princeton and news sports return for the year was an astonishing 34 percent. Black Monday was also a severe test to the efficient market hypothesis. It was difficult for many to see how a rational assessment of the market's value could have changed 23 percent in a single day. Black black monday caused...\n\nAnd this is the the the... I mean, it's... I was gonna say this surprising result, but kinda not surprising when people identify themselves with their ideas. Like, a good good advice is, like, you're or not your ideas, you should, like, discard them when you find information that clearly contradicts them. Well, the economist didn't.\n\nBlack Monday caused few economists to reject the efficient market I hypothesis this. Alright. So now I gotta tell you when Thor hedge fund is rated. And you might be saying what... Then no left myself as Wtf.\n\nLike, when I got to this part of the book. So what what are you talking? What what's was going on here? Alright. December 19 87, vans pull up in front of Princeton and Newport building.\n\nThey contain 50 federal agents of the Fbi treasury department Atf. They were armed and wearing bulletproof vests. They went through the filing cabinets packing documents into 300 boxes. They were under their orders to look for audio tapes especially. So as when Ed heard the news his an initial reaction was that it was nonsense.\n\nHe had followed followed the string of arrest on Wall Street like everybody else. This is happening at the time. The raid seemed to be some publicity stunt on the part of Rudy Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani is the prosecutor of the Southern New York, and a lot of people are saying he was doing this to to get public publicity for eventual run at either senator and governors partnership. Now here's the problem though. Did...\n\nI said earlier, it's important to pick the right business partners. And then I looked, myself I was like, oh, did Do actually have bad business bad partner. Ominous ominous, Reagan did not have much to enlighten thor. Everybody lawyer up, explain Thor. Trying to run a partnership was very difficult under these circumstances.\n\nActions spoke louder than words. Some of the East Coast partners took about 15000000 dollars out of the fun and replaced it under the names of their wives. So that looks real bad. Doesn't it. It turned out that someone had saved some tapes from December 19 84.\n\nThis is 3 years earlier. Stock parking would normally plague place at the end of the texture. So that's what they're doing. At the time, Thor, and his partner have a, 1 of their brokers is Michael Mill, Milk, the famous guy who one's inventing junk bonds and going to jail for a few years. And reagan and some of the people in the office.\n\nWell, I don't if Reagan was actually involved, but some traders in the office were doing this thing called stock parking, which would... They would... Basically 2 different companies are are pretending to to transfer assets to 1 another to avoid taxes. That's like a overs simplified way to think about it. Right?\n\nBut this is going on in the east coast office. Thor didn't know what's going on. So Thor got 1 call from the prosecution team. They wanted him to come and testify New York. And he told them.\n\nIf I do it, I'm gonna take the fifth. The Us office attorney took no... The Us attorney's office took no further direction against thor. So he was never even involved in all this. And he says my theory on I'm taking the fifth was, I didn't know anything.\n\nSo if I had... So I had no upside in going in and plenty of downsides. So was another trait that I find constantly from the the in these biographies, these people know how to to limit to cap their downside. The decision to test if I was just a prudent calculation. And here's the problem.\n\nIt didn't matter that he didn't do anything. Because that they they were being charged. The people that they were guilty, and they're... Julian is using the Rico act, which is mainly used to fight, like, organized crime. With So this is the end of their hedge fund.\n\nWhere Rico charges looming, the funds investors wanted out. In 19 88, Thor and Reagan dissolve the partnership. Positions were liquidate in the money returned to investors. He blames the situation on the dysfunctional partnership. We didn't really connect well his people.\n\nThor said of himself in Reagan. That was probably the crack and the Edi. If I'd realize the actions were being taken, they were more aggressively bold, closer to the line and I dare contemplate the whole thing wouldn't have happened. And Ed was pretty mad about this because he's like, had a great run, and you're trying to, like, save a little bit on taxes. So he says this is the financial results of their partnership.\n\nTo many portfolio managers today, the nate 18 year record of Princeton Newport partners is the definitive home run. A dollar invested in the fund at the beginning would have been close to 15 dollars by the time the fund ceased. Over 19 years, the compound return rate averaged 15.1 percent. After fees. During that same time period, the S and p averaged 8 percent.\n\nSo again, Samuel, another say it's impossible to do, and Thor doesn't care if you think it's possible we'll just go ahead and do it. And this is him on the end of the Princeton and Newport, Reagan and other prince and Newport defendants appealed their cases. All 6 convictions were overturned. So they might have not not even being able to convict them permanently. Thor came out un unscathed from charges.\n\nBut What he's upset about is they interrupted are compounding. So this is a destruction of wealth was huge thor preserved. The partnership employed about 80 80 people on 2 coasts. They managed 272000000 dollars of other people's money. Together, Thor and Reagan were collecting 16000000 a year in general partner fees.\n\nThis is in the eighties. Their own investments in the fund were compounding in an impressive rate and what happens? You've never ended up compounding. And Rico case is gonna interrupt your compounding. So he's he's really upset about that.\n\nFrom there on end, He he just... He runs this thing called Ed Edward Do and associates like, a series of of hedge funds. I'm not sure if he invest other people money. I think he does, but I think most. He just runs his own money too.\n\nAnd he's getting, like, 20 something percent returns. So that's what he's been doing from the the point in this the story today. He's still alive. He's 87 years old, and he wrote his memoirs was 2 years ago, and then he did a lot of publicity. At 85 years old for the book.\n\nI recommend you just putting at Edward Thor or Ed thor into into Youtube. And I've showed the video to 3 or 4 different people now. Everybody's... I was like, hold a that, guy? Tell me how hell is.\n\nLook, I don't know. 60 65. It's remarkable. I've never seen an 85 year old person. Look as good to him, and then not only that, like, still be so point mentally.\n\nIt's remarkable. Alright. So now I wanna get to the point that... Now we know that thor did well. I wanna talk with the people that thought...\n\nSo I wanna talk about the... The idea that that there's people that were not adhering to the Kelly criterion who wind up blowing up. So Thor had a chance to get to invest in Lt, which is long term capital Management. 1 of the most famous, like, hedge funds to blow up ever. And he declines for obvious reasons.\n\nSo it says, ed ed first heard of Mer weather Mer weather is the person that starts that begins Lt. So he's first heard Mary Fund through a mutual fun... Friend. It's gonna be a great investment therapist told, and for 10000000 dollars you can get into it. Like most of the new group of fund managers, Mary promised better than market returns through science and software.\n\nMay weather did not himself possess a first rate medical mine. Instead he recruited the top academic talent. No finance professor was more respected than Robert C Mer. So he recruited him. And his other greatest coupe was recruiting My skull sc.\n\nNow here's the thing. They also believe in efficient market hypothesis, but they're saying is there's tiny, tiny, tiny parts, temporarily where the market is not efficient, and you can make, like, 5 cents. Their point is they're gonna use a massive amounts of leverage so they could pick up a bunch of nickel. But what they're really doing is they're picking a bunch of nickel in front of a steam rolling. They just don't know that they're doing that yeah.\n\nOkay? So says Thor said not to put any money in this fund. He was concerned that Mer sc had little experience investing other people's money, and it didn't help that Mer was a critic of the Kelly Criterion. The general chatter was also that Mer weather was a high roller. The story was that if he got a hole, if things went against him, he would bet more.\n\nIf things still went against him, he'd bet even more, and this is what winds up doing... What what he winds up doing at at Lt. It's kind of the exact opposite of when I was describing a Kelly criterion to you earlier. It's a proportional betting system as your bank goes up, you bet more as it goes down, you bet less. What happens is Lt starts blowing up and they bet more.\n\nA larger percentage. It says Lt trading secrets were secrets. 1 thing was disclosed. Lt used a lot of leverage. For every dollar invest investor money, the fund borrowed 29 dollars more.\n\nSo this is this is the definition of Gambler ruin. This is also the way I want you to think about this is, this is what Thor and Shannon wisely avoided. This is... And this is an Lt did not. 1 term for Gambler ruin among the traders is blowing up.\n\nTo blow up an account is to lose everything in high risk trades with borrowed money. A stellar career can end in a few miserable days or ours. And so there's a there's a quote. If you listen to the podcast did last week on Jim Clayton that he compares, and we've talked about this a lot? The the fact that starting a company running a company a lot of times, it's counterintuitive.\n\nRight? You the thing you think your should do is the exact opposite what you should be doing. That's what makes it difficult. Right? And it's a complex adaptive system.\n\nIt's it's not not gonna behave in ways that are predictable. So Jim compared that to flying because he's a pilot too. And he says he's that something that I thought about, And I I, I've, like, kept the note. And he says, the thing you should do is the opposite. Like, you can get yourself in a situation flying in a business where the thing you should do is the opposite of what you feel you should do.\n\nSo Lt runs into the same thing. They're they're collapsing. And in the middle of the collapse, they do the exact opposite thing that they should. It says when they first started losing obviously, they had less discretionary wells, so they should have pulled down their leverage multiple on a proportional basis. Right?\n\nInstead, they allowed that leverage to drift up to, like 60 times. That was a horrible mistake. No Las Vegas gambler would ever make that mistake. No surviving 1. And so that is the almost the entire point of this podcast.\n\nIs to never put you wanna put yourself in a position. You cannot be successful, you don't survive. So therefore, never risk your survival ever. These guys didn't even understand that. They came from a different world.\n\nThey thought, oh, we have it all figured out. We're so smart. And so III wanna read this quote. Well, let me get to it. Warren Buffett is gonna...\n\nYou y, I don't even need to say because Warren Buffett quote here is amazing on it. And then the this next part I'm gonna read you. When I left... When I I read it, III left a note to myself. And it's that Steve Ai quote, the guy from the big short who made over a billion dollars shorting the the the, during the housing crisis and the financial crisis in 2008 2009.\n\nAnd, It's just amazing how many situations this quote applies to. And he says, the the quote is like, they must mistook leverage for genius. And Ai was talking about the 2 thou... The late 2 thousands financial crisis. This it can the same thing applies to what's happening then in the nineties and we'll apply in the future and a hundred years in the future, hundred years ago, This is human nature and human nature does not change.\n\nSo many of the partners have substantial fortunes before Lt that they rolled over into the fund. 1 partner was to be set was said to be in tears in 1 meeting. Why would you be tears? Because he had taken out a personal loan of 24000000 dollars to increase his stake in the fund. What is he doing?\n\nHe's using leverage to buy his own fund, which itself was operating at... Nose bleed leverage levels. His net worth went from something like over a hundred million dollars to negative 20000000 dollars. He requested that the bailout covers personal debts. Remember, it's just such a huge loss.\n\nThe Us Treasury had to bail them out. The consortium said no. And what a jerk? Sky wants the taxpayer to pay... I mean, that why am I even surprised or something like this?\n\nLike, I should know better right now. He requested that the bailout covers personal debts. Like, that's that's a terrible person. Now, this is what I was mentioning earlier. I love this warren Buffett Marvel than how 10 or 15 guys with an average iq of maybe a hundred and 70 could get themselves into a position where they can lose all their money.\n\nAnd that statement our Warren Buffett is really just echoing something a statement that was said 200 years in the past in 17 38 by this guy named Danielle B be. I don't how to pronounce it. He's credited with, like, being made maybe even, like, the most pioneering work in probably building statistics. And this is what he said this is what he wrote in 17, a man who risk his entire fortune acts like a simple. However, great may be the possible gain.\n\nThey're telling you to avoid there's... You should avoid risk of ruin. You should avoid fat tails. Says thor link the Lt now this is store on it. Link the Lt collapse to mu trolls intellectual critique of the Kelly Kelly system.\n\nSo Ed continues. He says, I could see that he didn't understand how controlled the danger of extreme risk and the danger of fat tailed distributions. It came back to haunt them in a grand way. Estimates about market probabilities are always just going to be that estimates. It is a good practice to have a sense of how far off these estimates may be.\n\nMargins of error are themselves estimates, and human nature often skews these estimates optimistic. A decade rarely passes without a market event that some respected economist claims with a straight face to be a perfect storm. It 10 sigma events or a catastrophe so fantastically improbable that it should not have been expected to occur in the history, entire history of the universe. If they keep happening, that means they should be expected. Shouldn't they?\n\nLike, that's obvious on its face. I don't understand how so called smart people don't understand that. In a world war financial models can be so incredibly wrong. The extreme downside caution of Kelly Bedding is hardly out of place. Alright.\n\nSo now we're gonna go back to Claude Shannon, and this is Shannon performance applying his ideas to the market. This is just fantastic. In 19 86, Barron ran an article, ranking the recent performance of 77 money managers. Claude Shannon, though not mention in the article had done better than all but 3 of the pros, and he's basically doing it his part time. The bear and money managers were mostly firms with up to a hundred people.\n\nShannon worked with his wife and a d intrepid Apple to computer. The 08/11/1986 Barron reported on the recent performance of 1026 mutual funds, Shannon achieved a higher return than 1025 of them. When Warren Buffett bought Berkshire Hathaway 19 65, over 30 years, he had a 20 return of 27 percent. By the late fifties through 19 86, Shannon stock return on his stock portfolio was 28 percent. It's also worth noting it's a little harder to do with larger amounts warren was worrying with larger amounts, but still, Shannon records amazing.\n\nRight? Again, this is what I like, well Shannon he he's... He he had an idea and he backed it up. He's like no I think efficient market there is bull wrap and I'm gonna see if I can teach myself how to do this, and he did. Okay.\n\nSo I wanna... We're almost done, but I wanna, go over this. So this guy few years later, Unfortunately, Claude Shannon went up suffering from alzheimer's alzheimer's disease. So, they're the writing... There's a guy named Hi who was a he was writing an article in Shannon portfolio, but he never published it.\n\nBut, Shannon wife got a copy, and and gave it to... I think... I don't know if you gave it to this author or somebody. Somehow, the the a william pounds Got his hands on it. This is a draft of Hi article along with Hi recollection, give the most complete view of how Shannon achieved these returns.\n\nIt had nothing to do with arbitrage. Shannon was a buy and hold fundamental investor. Now here's what Shannon is gonna tell Har. In a way, this is close to some of the work I'd done relating to communication an extraction of signals from noise. He said, Shannon, he said that a smart investor should understand where he has an edge and invest only in those opportunity.\n\nPiece. And I know I've said this before, but buffett and among, say the same thing over and over and over again in different ways throughout multiple decades, only invest where you have an edge. Find your edge and invest in it. This is more on how Shannon thought about price and value and the methods he used to invest. In the early 19 sixties, Shannon had played around with technical analysis.\n\nHe had rejected such such systems. He... This is Shannon talking now. Says I think that the technicians who works so much with price charts and head and shoulders formations and pledging neck lines are working with what I call a very noisy reproduction of the important data. Shannon emphasize.\n\nWhat we can extrapolate about the growth of earnings in the next few years from our evaluation of the company management and the future demand for the company's products, stock prices will in the long run follow earnings growth. Therefore, he paid little attention to price momentum or of volatility. The key data in my view, this is Shannon talking. The key data is, in my view, not how much the stock price changed in the past few days or months. But how the earnings have changed in the past few years.\n\nShannon plotted company earnings on log graph paper and try to draw a trend line into the future. He also tried to surmise while factors might cause the exponential trend to continue or sp out. The Shannon would also visit startup up technology companies and talk with the people running them. Shannon became a board member of Tel. He was not just a distinguished name in the annual port, but was actively scouting potential acquisitions for Ceo, Henry Singleton in other words, he had an edge.\n\nHe knew. He he knew He had a he had an understanding and access to information that other people did not. And this is also tells you why I'm re... Gonna be reading about Singleton soon, and it's gotta be a podcast you're gonna be able listen to. Warren Buffett himself said the Singleton had the best operating and capital deployment record in American business.\n\nIt is a... It is at least conceivable that Shannon judgment played a supporting role in his success. And this this next section, but no left myself is this is also why for entrepreneurs that own a profitable private business. It makes sense to do what Warren Buffett device. To treat your business as if it's the only asset your family has had for the next 50 years.\n\nIf you do that, it causes you to focus, and you're focusing on an area where we have an edge. See how that kind of plays together. Shannon portfolio would have appalled Harry Mark. Marco is the guy that create created Modern portfolio theory, which needless to say people like Buff Mu criticized heavily. I think it's it's t.\n\nAlright. So Shannon portfolio would have appalled Harry Mark. By this point, nearly 81 percent of the portfolio was in a single stock tele. The 3 largest holdings consisted of 98 percent of the portfolio. Shannon says, we have not at any time in the past 30 years attempted to balance our portfolio.\n\nAnd what is this echo? This that echoes what Carnegie said? Andrew Carnegie, you told us study how the great fortunes are wealth or, oh, great fortunes are made. It's not a scatter shot approach. It's putting all your eggs in 1 basket and watching that basket, which is what he did with this his steel company.\n\nAnd I'll close on this. This is, the Thor investment record. It says in May 19 98, Thor reported that his investments had grown at an average of 20 percent annual return over 28 years. To help persuade you that this may not be Luck or wrote, I estimate that I have made 80000000000 dollars worth of purchases and sales for my investors. This breaks down into something like 1 and a quarter million individual bets.\n\nAveraging 65000 dollars each with an average with on average hundreds of positions in place at any 1 time. Overall, it would seem to be a moderately long run with a high probability that the excess performance is more than chance. And I stop there because that last sentence, I think is what we're all trying to do in our individual lives. We're trying to have an I a high probability of excess performance that's more than chance. So if you wanna read the entire story, which I'd obviously recommend doing, I'll leave a link, that's an Amazon affiliate link, which means if you buy using that link, it also supports the podcast.\n\nAnd you you can also go to amazon dot com for slash shop, slash founders podcast podcasts. And if you buy this book or any of the other books, I also receive a small percentage to that sale. And if you wanna see what while I guess Already told you. I was gonna say if you... If you're treating this podcast like a book club, and you're gonna read with me.\n\nWhen you go to amazon dot com slash shop force slash runners. You always... I I always post the book I'm currently working on there. So you can order it right away. If you can read it in a week, already read by a time of podcast comes out.\n\nSo it's kinda like this this large book club, which is really cool. And if, you know want that you can go to Founders podcast dot com, and you can see all the books there as well. So thank you very much for the support. Thank you for listening, and I'll be back next week and we'll talk more about the wonderful life of Ed Thor.",
