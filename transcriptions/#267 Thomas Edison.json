            "transcript": "There were other notable American inventors in his time, but they were more usually lonely troubled souls, and his personality outs shown theirs. By 19 29, 2 whole generations of Americans had grown accustomed to watching the progress of this self educated man who worked in a laboratory that had its windows virtually open to all of the work. He had known how to drama his inventions. He had known how to gather interest, faith and hope in the success of his projects. He tip the independent loan handed inventor of the nineteenth century heroic age of invention. He had begun his work in the age of gas and ke lamps and was leaving it with the cities throughout the world lit up with his lights and music and voices sounding everywhere. That is an excerpt from the book We talked you about today, which is a 60 year old biography of Thomas Edison originally published in 19 59. It is Edison, biography written by Matthew Joseph. Okay. So I wanna tell you why Started with that paragraph, in particular, when I read that paragraph towards the end of the book, it made me think of Steve Jobs quote that we're here to put a dent in the universe. That paragraph describes the dent that Thomas Edison put into the universe. And so the way I think about the conversation that you and I are about to have, it's really a continuation of the conversation and I think started back on episode 2 63. To me, these last, I guess this is the fifth episode in a series that I think are heavily related to each other. So it starts back on 2 63 and 2 64 with Edwin Land, the founder of Polaroid, then 2 65 Steve Jobs and 2 66 Henry Ford. And the reason to me, just 1 conversation, that is peer over 5 different episodes is because they all admired and studied each other. So Edwin Land, studied Thomas Edison, Alexander Rome bell, who's also in this book that but I'm not gonna talk about today, and Henry Ford Steve Jobs is the 1 that turned me onto to all of them. So Steve jobs talked about how Edwin lane was his hero. Jobs also talked about what he learned from studying Henry Ford and Edison, and then you get to henry Ford and Henry Ford, essentially, Idol He winds up becoming the most best friends with Edison who's, like, 2 decades older in him, but he idol utilized Edison. And the reason I'm bringing that to your attention now is because Edison to me is different than land and jobs and fort. So when you and I are going through these books, when you're listening to this podcast. 1 of the main points is like, okay, This is how they did their life how they how they built their company. What are the ideas? Like, how can I let those ideas influence my life? And that is what I was thinking of as I was working through. This is a 500 page biography. It took me over 25 hours to read and actually ingest before I can sit down and talk to you about this. And so as I'm doing so, I like Edison. Like he is wicked smart, really funny, and he gave all of his life energy to inventions that made the world a better place. But if I had to choose between Edison approach to his life and his career and the 1 that Henry Ford, Steve jobs and Edwin Land used, I'm choosing ford jobs and land. Because I think what they did that Edison did not was focus. And this is not a criticism of Edison. I don't think he could. It was, like, go back to what charlie Mu says. You gotta follow your natural drift. Edison natural Drift was that he was curious well, a other things he wanted to work on a bunch of different things at once. Where if you go back and listen to the last few podcasts. Once Ford had 1 idea, or? He's like, I just wanna make an affordable car for the every man. And he dedicated his entire life for that. Once Steve jobs making starts making products, his same thing. He's like, I just wanna make insanely Products, and then I wanna build a world class organization that out me. Edwin Lynn literally invented the industry that he worked in in instant photography and dominated that industry for 4 decades. And I wanna give you another example. Was just reading Yesterday this fantastic newsletter It's written by my friend, Frederick. I'll link to it below. I feel a little funny and linking to it below because at the beginning he talks about me, but that's not why I'm linking to it. The entire thing is worth reading, but this 1 section. Frederick does a fantastic job of, like, weaving all these different ideas together. And so in his post, he has this story that warren Buffett is relaying, and Buffet is talking about being a dinner, I guess drinks maybe with Bill Gates and Bill Gates dad, and this is what Buffett says. Then at dinner, Bill Gates Senior pose the question to the table. What factor did people feel was the most important in in getting to where they've gotten in life. And I said, Buffet saying, focus. And Bill said the same thing. And if you think about just from that 1 post, the last 5 weeks of the conversation You and I've been having together. We have Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Henry Ford, Steve Jobs and Edwin land, all saying the exact same thing. Focus. A simple thing to say and a nearly impossible thing to do over the long term. So with that, let me jump into the book, I wanted read a description of some of the ancestors of the Edison family, which I found fantastic because they're are family full of miss. This 1 trait probably what I admire about, Thomas edison the most. It said, they were a simple hearty pioneering people. Most of them were short on education. The family was full of dis and eccentric. A marked family trait distinguish them. They were strong individual, often nay say and independent minded to the point of ob. Ob is just a fancy word for stubborn. And so when the author says, hey, they're a family full dissonance. He means that literally, there's a fantastic story. Edison dad had to literally run for his life. And if you think about this, this changed the entire trajectory of his son's life. So Edison dad was part of this, like, ins interaction movement where they were real literally trying to overthrow the Royal Canadian government, And so his dad's name is Sam says Sam Edison was publicly denounced as a leading figure among the would be revolution. Before Dawn, Sam was off through the woods, running like a deer towards United States border that was more than 80 miles away. He was hot pursued by the king's men. I don't know why that line maybe laugh, just the idea of being pursued by the king's men. By performing the incredible feat of running for 2 and a half days and stopping only for brief intervals of rest and food, he managed to reach the United States. Why is that important? Why am I reading the section to you This line explains that. It was by this stroke of chance that Thomas edison happened to be born in the heart of the American Republic that line is even more important because Not was he born in America but he's born at a time where in America at this point in history, they idol utilized the lone inventor. Edison lifelong fetish fertilization and grasping for as many patents as he could possibly gather was not an accident. It was heavily influenced by the light... By the by the this point in history they happened to live in where people thought that was their way to freedom and wealth. Then we fast forward to something that happens to Edison when 6 years old, that he remembers for the rest of his life. And so this is how the author describes this event. There's a bunch of people, they were gathering in the village square. Where where they gathering your sea. Sam Edison was whipping his youngest son. A public chest carried out in anger in the presence of the neighbors and their children, this is a crazy sentence right here. Sam Edison had advertised the event in advance. So it says a public cha carried out cold anger in the presence of the neighbors and their children was something drastic. Edison had set a little fire inside the barn, quote, just to see what it would do. He's 6 years old. The public t he received state this is why I'm reading this to. The public t he received stamped itself on the boy's mind and memory. For Thomas described it all 60 years later when he thought back upon his boy. From his description, we have a picture of the boy receiving blow after blow and early in life learning that there was inexplicable cruelty and pain in this world. That part especially stood out to me because this happened to me as well. I was 10 years old, and I lit a newspaper on fire in the house, and my dad beat a shit out of me. And I knew it had to be bad than the other times you beat the shed out of me because my mom was trying to again get with stop. And that's actually an important point because not that you see it in the books but also in your own life because my daughter is the same age I was when that happened to me, and I'm about the age. My dad was when he did that. And I could never imagine laying a finger on her. Never have never would. And so that the important point is, like... I understand it happened in their family and up and down the family tree and all that other stuff, but it's okay. It only takes 1 person, but be like, no. That stops here. And I think the idea that 1 person can only change the world around them, but also change the relationships that families have is exhilarating to me. So I wanna move forward. This is very bizarre. This is this is 1 the things I like about medicine. Right? Where he's obsessed with jesus just constantly ask questions. Constantly getting in trouble as we just saw, very mischievous, very independent minded. Very hard to control. In fact, on this page where we're I'm about to reach you it says he was very heads strong and will when you cannot have his way. Early signs that he was meant to be an entrepreneur. Right? But what was fascinating is that he had this life. He just knew He's like, I wanna invent things. And that's kind of bizarre when I'm gonna read the description of first inventor that he ever meets. And so this this guy says this this eccentric person named Sam Winchester. Often Edison would be found with his nose pressed against the back window of Winchester shop, watching the strange things being done there. The mysterious Winchester was constructing a passenger balloon. So he fills a balloon by hydrogen and he's trying to fly in a hydrogen and balloon. And the reason I think this is so strange is because again, this is the first inventor that a young edison z's. What's about to happen to guys not gonna be good. And as since like, yep, I wanna do that. And so it says he had a few attempts at flight didn't work out, but it says then during the the next trial, mister Winchester managed to ascend into the air, then was waved slowly in the direction of Lake Erie. Never to be seen again and to think Edison like, yeah. I wanna I wanna be an inventor after seeing this guy disappear into the sky. So Edison constantly getting in trouble. He's not people... Like, he can't even last in school. So he gets in so much trouble And he has to be homeschool. But his mom does something that so smart and intelligent here. And so she's gonna be his teacher. So I'm gonna describe her method of teaching, and then Edison is gonna tell you why this is so important that she did this for him. She literally changed his life. Nancy Edison had superior taste. Believing that her son was far from being dole. So what they're talking about is the fact that he didn't... He hated road memo immunization. He was very curious. He wanted to basically have, like, self directed learning his teachers at the time. Like, think about what kind of school he could possibly in, you know, this mid 18 hundreds. And I think they're in Rural Ohio. Well, basically, his his teachers misinterpreted his own, like, will for self directed learning as, you know, maybe this boy stupid. So her... His mom was like no, I I know my son, I think he's 12 at this time. And she's like, no, I'm pretty sure he's not stupid. So it says, she she believed that her far... Her son was far from Do. And she had unusual reasoning powers. She read to him from such books as the decline in fall of the roman Empire, the history of England and then from literary classics ranging from Shakespeare to Charles Dickens. He grew fascinated. Oh, he's actually 9. He's even younger and I thought. He grew fascinated, and at age 9 was inspired to read such books himself. He became a very rapid reader. This is 1 of my favorite things about Edison. Later on I'm gonna have highlight for you where he's not making a lot of money. I think he he he has to buy a subscription to a library. Right? And I think that... This subscription to the library equates to, like, 2 day, 2 full days of work. And there's no such thing as an 8 hour day. At its point history. He's working like from the time the sun rises to coming back, like, 10 and a 10 at night, and he's, like, 11. And so when he goes to the library. It's not like, okay. I'll just pick out some books. He reads the entire library. Every book, all of them. It's incredible. So I'll get there in a minute. She brought another book on physical science, which was called the school of natural philosophy this book changes his, he's got a few books that changed his life. This is the first 1, which is described an illustrated very scientific experiments that could be performed at home. The boy had truly caught fire. He read and tested out every experiment in the book. All of his pocket money went for chemicals purchased at the pharmacist for experiments. Thus his mother, and this is the important part the reason I'm reading this entire section to. Thus his mother had accomplished that, which all truly great teachers do for their pup pupils. She brought him to the stage of learning things for himself, learning that which most amused and interested him. And she encouraged him to go on in on that path. It was the very best thing she could have done for this singular boy, a amen at that, and he he sums us up for you and I. She let me follow my bent. So at 1 point in of childhood, his father of prosperous his business. There's was a lot of ups and downs. This is now the down where his father's not doing well. I think he might have even lost the business. So this is where he starts to work at 12 years old. This is actually gonna change his life. So... Okay. He's gonna actually save a young... He's gonna work in the railroad. He's gonna work on a train. And the reason and I'll get to this in a minute, but the reason this job that he gets a 12 is gonna change his life is because he's gonna save a young boy's life. I think the kid was, like, 3 years old. He was like, on a train track and edison some winds grabbing him before he could be hit by train. And in return, I think it's a station masters son. If I'm remembering this correctly. The station masters is, like, how can I ever repay you? Thank you so much. And he teaches Edison how to operate a telegraph. And why is that important Because Edison first experiments where I how to make a telegraph better? It may... This may sound stupid to you and I are like Silly to you and I? But at this point in history, the telegraph is the leading edge of communication technology in the entire world. The best description in case you don't know what it is, it's just a point to point text messaging system. So instead of sending a letter by horse that gets their 3 3, you know, 3 months later, and then maybe get a response 6 months after that. You can send a message immediately. If you were a young person interested in the Cutting edge technology at this point in history, you would have worked on the telegraph. So we'll get to that in a minute. He learned that there would be a job on the daily train for a news boy. So he's selling newspapers, and then he's selling, like food and suites to the passengers. He was only 12. And this is the beginning of these extremely long hours at work that he maintains his entire life. He would leave at Dawn and the young boy would return to home at 10 or 11 at night. And so this is the first example of a young edison relentless resourceful. There's all these times where, like, he's writing a train all day long. He has to get off and switch trains and sometimes there's like this long layover. Right? And so what does he do? He's constantly into in and out of Detroit And he realized realizes, hey, I have a a several hour layover every day, in Detroit, and there's this fantastic library, and this is the what I was referencing to you earlier. In Detroit during the hours of layover. He found his way to the public library. This is Edison describing this point in his life. My refuge was a Detroit public library. I started with the first book on the bottom shelf and went through the lot 1 by 1. I did not read a few books. I read the library. And so when I got to this section, it made me think of this what I caught... What I told you over and over again. I hope you've watched it. Have you watched... I hope you watched it 5 times right now. What I feel the best talk on Youtube for entrepreneurs is by the investor Bill Gu. It is called running down a dream how to succeed and thrive in a career you love. I will leave a link in the show notes Anytime I say, hey, there's something in show notes. It's in the show notes in your podcast, It's also available at founders podcast dot com. Okay? I will leave a link for the full video in the show notes. I will also leave Blake Robbins. Incredible notes on Bill Gu talk. And I'm gonna read from those notes right now, this is the section that came to mind when I read this part. Bill Girl says greatness isn't random. It is earned. If you're gonna research something, this is your lucky day. Information is freely available on the Internet. That's the good news. The bad news, and this is why I think the the this... I think this video is so important for entrepreneurs and founders to to watch and listen to over and over again because it just holds you to a higher standard. He goes into great detail. How bad people want. And, like, there's 5 examples how bad these people want the dreams that they... That they're going after. And this talk also helps shape my approach to founders. And so let me start this part Over, greatness isn't random, it is earned. If you're gonna research something, this is your lucky day. Information is freely available on the Internet. That's the good news. The bad news is, now you have 0 excuse for not being the most knowledgeable and any subject you want because it's right there at your fingertips. That is something Thomas Edison new instinctively. He is 12 years old? Yeah. 12 years old this time. And he's said alright, cool. I got access to the library. I'll read every single book. That's something he does throughout his entire life. I I have a bunch of. I I'm pretty sure. I'll get home him. I have a bunch of highlights. He just does this over it over again. And when, you know, he's studying a million different fields of study, and he's just like, okay, Work, and I start, he was extremely big on experimenting. But before he experimented, he would just... You would just see him laying on the floor, with like, 50 books on the subject. He's like, I'll just read everything. So let's go back to this fact that he's on this train. He's got this job. Now this a few years later. And again, resourceful it. He's like, well, I'm selling somebody else's newspaper for, like, a quarter. Why don't I just make my own? So he says he undertook the venture of editing, printing and selling a small local newspaper, which was produced in his baggage car. He sold 8 cents a copy and had a circulation of about 400 people. It was said to have been the first newspaper in the world that was published on a train. So that was a good idea. It's like, okay. Instead of selling somebody else's product, I can just make my own Here's the bad idea. He allowed another person to influence the direction. So he starts printing, like, personal stories of people in the industry because his friend convinced him that he would sell more. Prom is Edison like a 15 year old country boy. He doesn't know too much about human nature yet, and so this what happens to him. 1 of these candid little stories touch on local figure. This proved to be excessively candid. And so the person he's writing about did not like the fact that his business was put for everybody to read he says, I'm gonna find this edison kid, and I'm gonna extract my vengeance. So now this is a grown man, a grown adult, attacking and beating the hell out of a 15 year old kid. 1 day, the man cited the young editor near the docks. He laid violent hands on him and then threw him into the river. Shortly, after Edison closed down that operation. This is the event that changes his life that I referenced earlier, edison noticed that the 3 year old son of the station master was playing right on the main track in the path of the car. He dashed towards the child and snatched him up in order in time to avoid the car. The guy's name was Mackenzie, Mackenzie was filled with such gratitude and express a desire to repay him in any manner within his power. He had noticed that as him hung over his telegraph table constantly. He offered to teach the boy to be an operator. That is really important because even if he fell back and he made jokes out of his life, obviously, later on he's much wealthier than he is now. But he's like, worst case scenario I can always be a telegraph operator for 75 bucks a month. It's almost akin to being, like, a programmer today. So it says, with him within him within Edison that is, there's a passionate curiosity to learn certain things. So what they're talking about is, like, as soon as they start teaching him the telegraph, you had a hard time getting him up from it. He says he works alone at his experiments for long hours and enjoys himself heart. And so most of these telegraph operators are young man. They really don't don't know like myself here The telegraph operators were the digital nomads of their day. So it says, Edison could find work almost anywhere because the need for telegraph was so urgent during the Civil war. These were his wandering years that began when he was only 16. In those days, the strange new tribe of telegraph were generally young men noted for the p nomadic or Bo habits. They would travel light pitching their tents for a brief season in 1 place, and then journey on to another that seemed to offer greater pastures. A few steady young operators rose from the ranks to become industrial magnets like Carnegie because that's what 1 of the first jobs Carnegie. And I think he was around 12 at the time too. So not only do... Are they making good money for their for their age and their time. Their trade is in high demand. And also, they didn't really need much because they just hop a train. And in many cases, they were, like, trying to sleep in the offices where their telegraph were. So that's another trait that Edison would use his entire life. He would just fall asleep wherever... Whether he was in New York trying to build out the electrical system. Right? Or he's in Men low Park, He would just sleep where... Like, you go to the corner and just fall asleep. Fall asleep by a chair on a table. He just didn't really care. So if for the next few years, he comes obsessed with the telegraph. This is the electric telegraph. So remember, there is no electrical lighting before him, this is, like the cutting edge of electric... Like, if you have an electrical industry, it's manifested most pronounced... Like, it's most pronounced manifestation is in the telegraph. And so he's just sitting there constantly getting better at it constantly thinking ways to improve the telegraph. The reason that's important is because what he's focused on now leads into everything else that happens in his life after. The germs of many ideas and strategies perfect by him in later years were implanted in his mind when he worked at a telegraph. He described this phase of his life afterward. His mind was in a tool. He said, It was besieged by all sorts of ideas and schemes, the future potential of electricity obsessed him day and night. It was then that he dared to hope that he would become an inventor. And the next step in his life that was hugely important was he discovers his hero. This is when he discovers his hero, Michael Fair. And so Edison fired up about being an inventor, but at this point he still has a job. And the problem is, like he kinda neglect his duties to follow whatever he's most excited about at this point. He intended to be reserved at this point in his life, he could become excited environment in expo his novel schemes. He would hold forth with undeniable el on every conceivable subject accepting that relating to the prompt dispatch of messages that the company had on file for transmission. So that's 1 of his c saying, hey, this guy knew a lot of stuff. He would speak passionate about it, but he would neglect his work. And if he kept doing that, he's gonna get fired and says his job to him was a dis bondage. It was at this time that he bought a secondhand hand copy of Michael Far book, experimental researchers and electricity. Edison said, This first encounter with the great English scientist journals on his experiments was 1 of the decisive events of his life, what I wrote down here. We've seen this over and nerve again. Not only did Edwin land also, Michael Far was 1 of his heroes and somebody that he studied immensely. But there's always like, a book that changes everything. So in Lance case, it's that book on light by the physicist would that he would keep underneath this pillow and read like the Bible he said. But what really popped to mind when I got to this point. Was what Buffett said, that the the day that he discovered Warren Buffett said the day he discovered Ben Graham book changed his life. The exact same thing is happening in Edison life right now, and I think he's around 19 or 20 years old. So it says, this... Was 1 of the most decisive events of his life. This is why. Here at last was the lucid exposition of Far long searches in the field with most fascinating the young edison. And it was steep in the spirit of truthful and humility before nature that was always in Far character. His explanations were simple, Edison said. And then he starts seeing parallels between Far days life and his life. He's was like, okay, There's another me out there. It's very comforting. Michael Far had been poor, like Edison. And though virtually without schooling had taught himself everything too, like Edison. And so check out Edison insane schedule. He he purposely picks the night shift because few lot less messages come in overnight, and it gives him more time to learn. So it says though he'd worked to an early hour in the morning at the telegraph office, Edison began reading Fair days book when he returned to his room at 4AM and continued throughout the day that followed so that when he went back to the telegraph office, he had not slept he was filled with determination to learn all that he could. 2 sentences here that give you an idea what's happening. His brain was on fire, and then this is a fantastic quote. He he He loves the word hustle. And he loves hustle. He likes hustling. He say he repeats it over and never again in the book. He's Hilarious. I've got so much to do And life is so short. I'm gonna hustle. So this is where he gets the inspiration to become an entrepreneur. He is rather crazy for doing this because it's 1 thing okay. I'm gonna sort of business there's a demand for the product. He's like, I gotta invent the product I'm gonna sell and I haven't invented it yet. So to describe why this was important. I'm actually gonna read from a different book. So this is technically the fourth book on Edison that I've read. The first 1 was the wizard of Mon Park. I'll leave all the episode numbers and the show notes for you. The wizard of Men Park, then I read empires of Light, which is about the the war of the occurrence between Edison Tesla and West house. That's episode 83. And then I read, the book Va bonds, which is about the relationship between Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. And that's episode 1 90. But this excerpt that I'm about 3 2 comes from the book, the wizard of V Park. I think this is might been, like second or third episode I ever data of founders. And really, I think it describes just what was important to Edison and this is the step 1 in chasing after the stream, having one's own shop, working on projects of one's own choosing. Making enough money today, so 1 could do the same tomorrow. These were the modest goals of Thomas Edison when he struck out on his own as full time inventor and manufacturer. The grand goal was not nothing other then enjoying the autonomy of entrepreneur and forest stalling a return to the ser dude of employee. And so his first invention flops, I'm gonna skip over that because I thought this such just fascinating, and this leads to so many opportunities after this, and it's a great example of that maximum that you and I always talk about the history doesn't repeat human nature does. And so it says during the gil age after the Civil War, spec in gold and securities on all the financial exchanges were, of course, greatly dependent on the telegraph. Market quotations were rushed rushed by wire to distant cities and to newspapers all over the world. And so he's identified a willing party that would pay for his adventure, which he's like, hey, there's these things called stock ticker. They already exist. I guess this is, I guess I need to pause here too because this is another maximum in that and Always talk about Way, especially at the beginning of your career. Imitation pre proceeds creation. We are all going to build on the work of people came for us. In many cases, the first few iterations of our product are gonna be imitation of them as we understand and we go along and we learn more. And we understand more of what we're doing. Then we get to actual creation. So the very... And that's that's exactly what happens in Edison career. The very beginning is like, okay, there's it's already stock Let me just take an existing product and make it a little better because it's like, there's clearly, like, the people are trying to sell gold or speculate in all kinds of instruments. If I can get their information faster or better, they will pay me for the ability to do so. That was true in the 18 seventies when this is happening, and it's still true today. And so that's the first reason I'm reading this to you, the second reason is because he gets taken advantage. This is what I meant about. I'm not gonna call him a cautionary tail by any means. But if you looked at Ford, and land and jobs. They always had control over what he did. Edison was so scatter brain. He never did. And so he gets taken advantage of later on, by people like Jay Gold, Jp jpmorgan morgan. I mean it's not really his fault. I'm not, like... I don't want to think I'm, judging this guy for any means. Like, imagine being in your twenties. And he was 22 when Jay Gold advises patents. Like, come on. Undoubtedly, Jay Gold would have tied me up in pretzels if that was me and when I was trying to 2. Each still you still me that to me today. You're talking about 1 of the most sophisticated investors and entrepreneurs to ever walk the planet. Let me finish this before I get ahead of myself. So says edison could conceived a number of refinements on the stock ticker, which he incorporated in his own model. This was his second invention, and he acquired another back who would lent him some money. He was in his early twenties, Edison was a whirlwind of activity sleeping little and working all hours of the day and at night. His patent rights were sold off to a large telegraph company, and thanks due to his want of business experience, meaning he didn't know what he was doing. Edison received almost nothing for his work on this venture. That is why I'm reading this to you. The early career of Edison is him constantly linking up with bad partners. Go back to what. I came remember of his warren buffett but Charlie Mu said that you can't make a good deal with a bad person. And 1 thing is clear from history you should not expect other people to not act within their own interest. And so in many cases these are much older men. They see, like, this young country bump. He may be a great inventor, but he doesn't know much of anything else. And so they're like, okay, We can take advantage of this guy and that happens over and over and over again. So I think the warning there is just be very very careful about who you're letting into, like, your your work and who you're partnering up with. Because after this happens, he's left with no money. So he's in Boston and he's gotta go to new York. He can't raise money for anything. And what's crazy is like, you find somebody that may be... They're gonna make the point here. Like, there's very few people on the planet than knew more about telegraph, like, the the science and technology telegraph, telegraph, than Edison to at this point. Yet. He literally has to borrow money. Like, he has no money. He's almost homeless. So it says the moment was a desperate run. He was deep in debt. He seemed to have gone from 1 failure to another. Step by step, and now his credit in Boston was virtually ruined. There was no chance of finding new patrons or investors for his experiments. His only hope was to reach the bigger city of New York. He arrived the next morning in New York with not a coin left in his pocket. And this is why there's such a, a disconnect between the knowledge and the talent that he has in his financial station in life at this point. There were not even 10 people in America who knew the tricks that he had with currents, relays and resistance for the telegraph. His mind buzz with ideas for improvements in electrical communication. He described himself as a fire with no chimney through which his smoke might escape. So at this point, Edison 22, no money but to tell all these telegraph people like is very common and all the engineers and everything. They can kinda know each. And so he goes and seeks out this other guy named Pope. And Pope is working in this company called the gold indicator company. And so the gold indicator company is just another company set up. This is really, like, there's a... There's multiple versions of this basic idea in different forms throughout the book, but it's essentially saying that any machine that facilitated or sped up communication concerning this key market assumed immense importance. Remember, this is New York City in the 19 fifties. Okay? By the... By the 18... 18 50. Sorry. By the 18 fifties, the telegraph was the prime instrument for rapid financial intelligence. And so that is what this company traffic. They traffic and rapid financial and intelligence. Okay? So he just happens to seek out this guy. Pope Pope is working in this office, and he's got great timing because he's gonna wanna getting hired at this company that's transmitting value information to investors. Right? And he gets hired by by being immediately useful. The day he shows up the entire system goes down. And Pope who's the head engineer there can't figure out what's going on. And so while Pope and the founder of the company are yelling each other and are all going crazy, you have all the customers like, they're literally the customers like rushing their office. They're like, dude, the thing that you sold us, it's off. It's not working. I need this information so they're going crazy. And so it says, Edison had been quietly engaged and looking over the machine himself and soon ascertain the cause of the trouble. He managed to convey to them to his belief was that 1 of the contact springs had broken off and dropped between the 2 gear wheels which stopped the whole mechanism. Fix it, fix it fix it Be quick for God's sakes, laws yelled at him. This is the guy that owns the company. That's about to hire him. Remember, Edison does not work this company yet. So it's like, yelling is, like, fix it and fix and fix it. So it says within 2 hours the gold indicators quotations, we're being communicated all over the street once again. And so laws is like, okay, who are you strange kid. How the hell to do that, They wind up talking and then Laws was like, I'm gonna hire this guy right away. Laws hired him at once at a larger salary than he had ever received. And so now this guy got this giant organization that edison can actually apply his trade too. A fruitful and prosperous period had opened for Edison who now perfect protected a whole series of new devices, mainly refinements upon the telegraph. This instrument was Edison first great love. This is why Keep bringing it up to. We cannot understand the image invention of the pho. The invention of the electric light. The invention in many ways of the early movie industry. And everything else that Edison did without understanding this period of his life, everything was built upon this. At this was Edison first great love, the primary invention out of which many other in innovations were to float. That way I just ran over my own point there. Some of them eventually destined to sup the Morse instrument itself. And so they're talking about Samuel Morris inventor of the telegraph, Edison along with Bell. Obviously Bell credited this, Edison try to figure out was like, how can we do a speaking telegraph? That's the way telephones. Is hilarious. That's the way telephones were thought of at this point in history? It's like, well, a telegraph will transmit text. How can we how can we get it to transmit voice. And if you think about what it early telephone that is. Really to this day, it's like a speaking telegraph. Now this part blew my mind. Okay? So you know or you probably know? I did this podcast on Jay Gold. This is back on episode 02:50. If you haven't listened to it, you kinda listen to it When you're done listening to this goal? Listen to? Why is jay gold? Why does this think Episode 02:58. Important why studying and and reading about Jay Gold important because if you asked Rockefeller, who's the best businessman ever met? He said Jay Gold without hesitation. Cornelius is van, who doesn't give out give out compliments for anything. Said Jay Gold was the smartest man in America. And at that time, Van was, like 40 years older than gold. You got to study J Gold. The reason is blew my mind is because in that book that I read on gold, and I'm gonna read many more in the future. And that podcast, I talked about that, Jay Gold became infamous because he tried to corner the gold market. I had no idea. That the person inside the gold indicators company, transmitting all of these quotes on the gold price of gold, the day this is happening was 22 year old Thomas Edison. That blew... I always say, like, it's amazing how many events in history are kind of inter lock and connected to 1 each other. This is crazy. It says he was an eye witness to 1 of the most stirring events in America's financial history. So after the whole, like, market collapses. He goes outside, climbs up on, like, a telephone pole. And he's so because he's got no fight... It's like, when your financial markets melting down. Right? He's a 22 year old okay with almost no money. I think he's, like sleeping at the office or something at this point. So he's just looking at these grown men losing their entire life's Fortune going crazy, and he can kinda just step outside of kind of like this be bermuda spectator. But that's wild. The day j gold tries a corner J gold and for its f. Is it F or f fist. Can't remember his part j j's name at the moment. It did AFF. But, yeah, the day that happens, Edison innocence actually, the 1 at the machine. That's remarkable. So there is a telegraph monopoly at this point. It's Western Union. This is the 1 Jay Gold is actually going to fight with. And 1 of the weapons that Gold uses to fight that monopoly is actually patents that Edison, they were actually patents granted to Edison. But Edison is a freelance inventor at this time. So he's selling... He'll sell his patents and and his invention to, you know, basically, the highest bidder, I guess, per s. So he's actually selling something to Western Union at this point. And I just wanna bring this up because It's the continuation of this idea that Edison just keeps making more and more improvements to telegraph stock ticker. And as a result of doing so and keep doing so. I think this is now 2 years later. Are thereabouts, he gets his first big payday, And I thought the description of that was rather funny. And so he's meeting with the people at Western Union says, well young man, the committee would like to settle up the account. How much do you think they are worth his invention. Edison was uncertain about what to demand. He had thought that he should ask for 5000 dollars. Instead, he said, can you make me an offer? And then the guy from Western union said, how would 40000 dollars strike you? And Edison was Hilarious because he's describing this later on He goes, I felt near faint. Edison managed to s the s her out that the the offer seemed fair enough. He gets the money in cash, goes back to his, like, little... He's in a ding boarding house in Newark, New Jersey. This is just 1 sentence funny out had to reach to you. He sat up all night unable to sleep for fear of being murdered for the sake of his great... His great reward. He never seen so much when he's like. He's like, Somebody's gonna kill me for this. So now We fast forward a few years in the story. He's 26 years old, and he makes the mistake, and he corrects it later on when he opens up Men Park, but he's just like, he's, like, trying to invent. He's trying to be an inventor and a manufacturer at the same time. So eventually, he's gonna realize, hey, pick the wrong path and he's gonna change course. But I wanna bring up how he managed because he... The way he managed that when he's was 26 years old, and very... It's very much the way he managed her has entire life, and it's why he had a lot of dedicated employees That worked almost our entire lives with him because they didn't work for him. They worked with him. Edison was as dirty as any other work man. I immediately felt that there was a great deal to him. 1 of his employees said. He was like no other shop offs. Those men had ever known. He was approachable and yet in the next breath, he was very severe with them, and he was bent on keeping them quote unquote, hustling perpetually. His intuitive powers in his endless curiosity about everything amused and intrigued his coworkers. He showed them an irr irreversible enthusiasm like that of a child. He kept his men at work long hours, but he himself would work even longer. Working a bunch of different ideas. But the most important idea that's gonna come out from this period of his life is what's called the multiplex telegraph system. Think about it So it's like, way to send 2 message simultaneously. So it essentially takes the existing telegraph machines and makes... It just allows them to send more messages. This is 1 of the weapons gold it's gonna use in his war against Western Union. But it says, Edison Smith, I wanna read this part to you because he's... This is 1 of his most important inventions, and it also reminded me of Edwin Land where, like, he'll just read it all. Like, Edwin Land goes and reads every single book on light and the Harvard library, then he goes to New York and reads every single book on light in the New york Public library. You see the same thing that Edison is doing over over again. And so it says Edison methods of investigation were described. As requiring complete knowledge of everything that had ever been done before in such a field as automatic telegraph. Books and periodic articles describing all that these other experiments had done, and, and all these other people had attempted, and indeed, all records of previous experiments and automatic mechanisms, were acquired. And 1 of his employees is describing edison At this point. I came in 1 night and their set Edison with a pile of chemical books that were 5 feet high. This is kinda what my house looks like. But their biographies entrepreneurs nurse. He studied them night a day. He in is a desk and slept in his chair, I don't do this thank God because I have a family. But I'm glad I do have a family because I think I would. And so another thing about edison is, like, the cautionary tale aspect is I think especially, you know, I know a ton of entrepreneurs were obsessed people, and I think having guard rails on your obsession is necessary because you're... It's very likely that you'll over optimize. If the history your entrepreneurship is any indicators of such. I think it's highly likely that you'll over optimize your professional life to the detriment of your personal life. Edison definitely did that. You know, His kids are in this book, and I don't know if I'm gonna read this to you later or not, but his kids are the books and, you know, we didn't know our dad. He didn't spend any time with us, that kind of stuff. And if somebody is smart and has driven his edison, made this mistake, then what's likelihood that you and I won't. It's very likely they will. So again, cautionary tilt to some element. I came in 1 night and they edison with the Apollo books. That was 5 feet high. He studied them night day. He ate his desk, he's slept in his chair. In 6 in 6 weeks, he had gone through all the books, made 2000 experiments produced a solution that could do the 1 thing that he wanted. And so this gets the attention of Jay Gold. There is, like, gold a huge like supporting character in this book. I'm not gonna... I think I listening in 02:58, you'll get an idea of of gold. I'm just gonna give you a couple things from him Mj Gold, had taken over the ownership of this other company called the automatic telegraph company. And he he bought the company because he wanted his new telegraph patents, and this is the instrument that he's gonna use to wage war with Western Union, Gold had determine to force his way into the rich telegraph field. This is very fascinating how he realized it was really important because Gold had a lot of idea where you can... You can identify an opportunity because you have deep knowledge about 1 industry and you see that there is an industry developing in parallel to that industry that you know about. You can kinda get there before anybody else. I don't know if that was very clear. Let me read this and hopefully it becomes clear Gold had determined to forces his way into the rich telegraph field. Gold began to build up an independent and competing telegraph system whose real object was to harass and raid. Western Union's empire until they'd be forced to pay him his price. By acquiring this company, Gold had also acquired the services of Thomas Edison and the rights to his automatic patents, A powerful pawn in the campaign for the conquest, of the nation's telegraph system. Edison at this point was completely oblivious to any of this. All he was focused was like, trying to make the best adventure possible trying to make the telegraph more functional and hopefully, build a business around that. He didn't understand what a lot of these, like, Robert Baron characters were doing. And so what I was referencing there, I thought this is a section I was I was actually confused, but Gold makes the point later on the book that as he's developing that it was very common for telegraph lines to be laid next to railroad tracks, but the railroad tracks came first. And so he's heavily invested in railroads, and he's noticing this parallel technology shoot up. He's like, oh, I'm gonna dominate the railroads, Might as able to dominate that too. At 1 point, Edison describes all the stuff that's happening in his life that he doesn't understand a strange financial warfare, which is a great way to think about it. But he also learns a little bit about that. And we'll get to that 1 second on the very next page. But this is why, like, it's very highly if you are a young person interested in technology you'd be doing exactly what Edison was doing. At this point. It's like, why would you work on the telegraph, And I've tried to explain this to you earlier. I don't know if it was clear, but this is pretty clear. The importance of the telegraph in 18 50 to 18 80 before the day of the telephone, was the mighty impetus it gave to the American economy can scarce be measured nowadays. So the importance of the telegraph, the the mighty impetus gave to the american economy economy can be scarce measured nowadays. Okay. That wasn't actually very clear at all. That's actually a little weird writing. Basically what they're saying, is that the the entire information economy is running on the telegraph. Just like the entire information economy today runs on the Internet. So if you're working on the Internet highly likely you would work in the telegraph at this point. So eventually, Edison has a vague idea of what all these people are doing and why these telegraph companies are are being bought and try to be merged 1 another, you know, because Western Union's kind of relentlessly mono the entire industry. So it says, I'm gonna read this paragraph you, and I'm gonna read what I think you and I could take away it. Although Edison invariably posed as a country boy who knew little about the ways of the wicked world. He had already appreciated how inventor patents, even this is a really important phrase here. Even without operational value. So he had already appreciated how inventor patents even without operational value could be used as pawns are bargaining measures by money patrons of applied science. If you think about what is happening behind his thinking, he's asking, what is an asset that you have inside your company that is valuable to other people. And so Gold actually gives some 30000 dollars for Han invention. And Edison like, holy. Shit. This is amazing. But again, I think this is hopefully the last time I mentioned gold because he's all over this book. But this is again, fascinating the way that gold mined worked. It says it was said, but at the time when the news came out that Edison had been lured into Gold camp, the stock of Western Union fell sharply under heavy short selling by Jay Gold, so that he that he gained, so gold gains in a single day, 20 or 30 times, that which he paid the young inventor. So he used... He convince Edison, hey, I will give you 30000 dollars. Edison is like, oh crap. That's a lot of money. I'll take it. Gold uses that news to drive down Western Union stock. Obviously, he short soul it, and so he makes 20 or 30 times in 1 day, what he gave to Edison. And then I'll wrap up this section just with 1 paragraph because this explains to you and I, like, first of all, edison is 27 years old at this point in the story. But why is Jay Gold in Western Union fighting over Thomas Edison? Like, what is happening here? And so says, why did the great barons contend with each other in the courts for possession of Edison Quad. It was not only a superb invention, but 1 of the most important contributions to the telegraph art and would bring dominance of the great industry to whoever owned it. So the last decade that he's been in York. It has been... He starts out with no money. Right? Then makes a lot of money then goes down. Is like, there's these peaks and valleys that are that are happening. He's under incredible financial stress. He gets like a payday. And this is where he's like, okay. I need to change course. Now he's almost 30 years old. He's like, I need... I'm getting out of New York, and I'm going to the middle of Nowhere New Jersey, and I'm going to build a laboratory of science at Men Park. And so there's a few authors that have stated that they actually think this... The the his creation of Men low Park was just a significant invention because it was, like, the first of the laboratories to pursue, like, practical commercial applications of research, and that was all it did. And Edison arrived at that just by following his natural bend. It's like, this is just what I wanna do. I wanna wake up, I wanna invent all day long. Not worry about money, not worrying about manufacturer and then do that tell Tired, I'll take an nap, and I'll just get up and do the same thing over and over again. And so this is a quick description until, like, his frame of mind for doing this. My notice is after a decade of financial struggle he wants to build a library. This is the Men park part of Edison or not library laboratory. This is the Men park part of Edison life. He turned back on the threshold of the Hidden world of electronic science and turned back, abandoning these perplexing experiments to devote himself to to other more immediately rewarding investigation. So what they're talking about there is that This is where again, I think the focus of a ford, a land in a jobs is gonna yield superior economic results in your lifetime for sure. He would invent something. And then once he figured it out, he kinda like, jump onto to the next thing. Like, he's gonna vent the pho graph, which just think about it, like, pho photograph is, like, the first way that you could have recorded audio in the world. He invent it, and then doesn't try to commercially exploit his invention for like, 10 years and by that time, there's all these other competitors. He's making a lot of non economic decisions, which may be better for the world, but weren't better for his truck. He was by no means a poor person, but the difference in wealth though, like, a ford or jobs and a land had access to. It'd be like 50 times, a hundred times more than than maybe even larger than Edison did. So that's what I'm talking about there. But it's is as at this stage his career, he was prosperous again, but he was also determined to bring about a sweeping change in his way of life. This is actually smart what he's doing. It's like, you gotta build a company that Liked to enjoy working in it. He had built companies. He didn't enjoy working in. He must at all cost quit business he said and manufacturing and live in some quiet retreat where he could give himself entirely to the vocation he loved. Invent research. So that is the why behind Men low park. And then a few pages later, I write. This is interesting and a course to be avoided. So they're talking about, hey, why the hell did you set up men parking in the little nowhere? And... Because to Edison, like, why do you need distractions? So he brings people out there? They'd build like, little houses they like a little scientific community, but there's nothing for, like, the wives and the kids to do. And so it says this became a community devoted to experimental science. What would these people do to entertain themselves here in the quiet back water? They would invent things. Edison said. And after that, they would invent more things. So I gives you a perfect insight to, like, what was important to him not realizing that other people were not gonna share his obsessive 24 7 nature on inventing. Now, he is also a very charismatic person. And so he's able to convince people to share his mission, but also in many cases, it actually goes against what's actually good for them. And so this is what I mean when I got to this section I was like u, nope. Not doing this. John Ot, who served under Edison for half a century, at the end of his life described the sacrifices as some of Edison old coworkers workers had made and commented on their reasons for doing so. My children grew up without knowing their father. He said, When I did get home at night, which was seldom, they were in bed. Why did you do it? He was asked? Because Edison made your work interesting. He made me feel that I was making something with him and that I wasn't just a work man. And then in those days, we all hope to get rich with him. So this is more about Men Park and why Edison did this, and he he loved it. The years at at Men Park from 18 76 to 18 81, by odds, the happiest and most fruitful Edison life. He was in his early thirties, and at the very height of his creative powers. The business of inventing was humming along. He was in a happy condition of being a liberty to absorb himself in a whole variety of inviting studies. Here, he could allow himself to meditate, permit his mind to wander even a play without fear of interruption. When he wished to inform himself on some special subject of moment to him, he would gather together a great mass of books, lay them out on the floor, fling himself down among them and then pour over them for hours on end. After which he would go back refreshed to the manual part of his task. And so 1 thing he works on is he actually finds a way to record voice and then replay it back at a later time. This event eventually can take form in a product called the pho photograph, but he also had, like a primitive way to actually transmit human voice over long distance, and it was actually under the heading in his notebooks of something called the telephone repeater. The most interesting part of this section though is not that. What's most interesting is that who he tried to sell this technology to and why they would not buy it. So he says he approached Western Union people with the idea of reproducing and recording the human voice, but they saw no conceivable use for it, and there's an exclamation point at the end of that sentence by the author. And so you think about this? It's like, Western Union was a telegraph monopoly. They did not wanna believe or maybe was impossible for them to believe. This is really a a less of human nature if you think about it. So they don't wanna believe or they don't wanna see or maybe they can't see anything that would disrupt that. So if you're inventing something or your new product renders another product obsolete, probably the worst place to go and sell that product is a person that has economic incentives that your product does not continue. I talked about this on Episode 200 with James Dyson because he's like, what the hell going on here. I built a technologically superior vacuum. I go to the vacuum cleaner companies, and they don't even see it. They're like, this is crap. And he realized like, oh, my vacuum is bag. It does not have a bag and these dudes, sell 500000000 dollars with of bags every year. Of course, they don't want. They can't see what is against their economic incentives. So that's where we realized. Like, I gotta do this myself. So this is when he invent the pho photograph. I'm gonna skip over that part because what he does is he sets it aside. So it's like the lack of focus are a different area of focus. I guess, 1 way to think about it. And he starts getting this idea that he's eventually gonna event which is the electric light bulb. Right? And this is 1 way to describe that. 1 undertaking particularly gripped his imagination, it was described as being that of dispel night with its darkness from the arena of civilization, dispel night with its darkness from the arena of civilization is what you and I call the electric light. So Edison is gonna need a ton of money to build out the entire electrical system. Right? And so he's gonna link up with Morgan and van and all these other people in a minute. But I wanna pull out something that was very interesting. It has mentioned a few times previous in the book, but I hadn't drawn your attention to it. And it's the fact that it says he had an heir of supreme confidence with which he sought to impeach everyone around him, including interested capitalists. So he was very good at selling others on his ideas, including selling people like investors on the fact that hey, you should give me money, to pursue this invention because we can turn it into a company. And the note of myself on this page is passion is infectious. Danny Lu 500000 dollar check story. So Danny Lu is was the cofounder of Aka I, and I read his biography years ago. It's called no better time. And the reason this came up now is because Danny Lu is also widely believed to be the first person killed in the 09:11 attacks. He was in first class on 1 of the planes stood up to try to do something when they were hijacking and who stabbed to death. He was only 31. But in his biography, it talks about that he completely believe in what he was doing. And once you believe in something, it's easy to transfer that belief to other people. So Just wanna read a section from this book called no better time. And it says stunned by what he saw Lou at the whiteboard, free. This is a investor said he felt a familiar sensation. The same 1 he experienced when he watched some of his top musical talents at the start of their careers. Danny was like ambition and Intellect on steroids he said. His belief in this thing was so profoundly convincing that I believed too. So that's what I meant about the transferring of the belief, which is extremely powerful, which is exactly what is happening in this... Where we are in the book with Edison. Right He's transferring his belief in electric light to people that he needs help with. Right? On the spot freeze pulled out a checkbook and handed Danny a check for a half a million dollars. And when I read that book 4 years ago whenever it was, the note of myself from there was passion was worth half a million dollars and more. And see so you go back to the Edison book, he had an heir of supreme confidence with which he sought to imp everyone around him including interested capitalists. And so this is when he starts partnering up with Van. This is Van built Son, because Cornelius had just died and left think, like, 95 percent of his money to a soul Son and Jp Jpmorgan. There's a lot more detail in the other podcast I did on Episode 83, which is Empires Light. That entire book is just about this point in Edison life. So it goes into way more detail in the book my hand, but I wanna pull out a few things here because I think they're important for you and I'd I understand because he's gonna... You know, he gets kinda, you know, screwed over multiple times by partners. In effect, the western Union people were buying rights, but not an existing invention, but in an unknown quantity, a promise. Edison said. Their money was invested in confidence in my ability to bring it back again. Undoubtedly, these financier were risking, we're taking risk with their capital, though, for such for as people's as wealthy as the Van belt, so at the time was a Richest man in America, it was only peanuts. So it's a collection of very rich people he's raising money from. 1 is the Van built, Jp jpmorgan the 1 organizing all this, which I get to a minute, but at some of them were also, like, the founders and executives in Western Union who are extremely rich at the time. Behind this whole venture stood Jp jpmorgan, who kept his name off the board of directors, but had its partner serving as director of the new company, and they also made it the company bank with Morgan's firm. So his name might be off of it, but he is very much in control. Edison believed that the chances of ultimate success of his project were fast greater because of the Morgan connection. The launching of the Edison electric light company by such sponsors is noteworthy also that it ina a phase of increasingly close close relations between big big and technology in this company. So how think about Great is this. Remember the words that you and Are talking about right now, they were written in 19 59. And he's like, this is a phase of increasingly close relations between big business and technology in the company. Are shooting in the country. Even more so today. And so before I move ahead, I wanna read this section from Empire's light because this is how this story ends. And so it was that Jp jpmorgan whose house had been the first in New York to be wired for electricity by Edison, a decade earlier, now erased Edison name out of corporate existence without even the courtesy of a telegram or a phone call to the great inventor. Edison biographer, Matthew Joseph, which is the guy that wrote the book on holding my hand, wrote Morgan... To Morgan, a made little difference so long as it all resulted in a big justification, big trust for which he would be the banker. Edison had been in the vocabulary of the times organized, and that was something that pops up in these books over and over again. Would prey on week, finance financially weak companies. If they needed his money and his... The money of his investors, then he would take over in many car parts take control of the company, combine them with other companies, they... This happened so much that there's was a term for it that term was organized, and that is the beginning of general electric. Book goes on for quite a while, how difficult you can imagine trying to build the electric industry from scratch. There's just 2 lines. Actually, I was just having this conversation with my daughter this morning before school. So it says, he seemed to be meeting with fresh difficulties at every step that sentence 1 and then step sentence to, no great n can be obtained without considerable doubt and tribulation. So really, the the summary of what's happening on across these, like, set up like, 20 pages is problems are the rule, not the exception. And so the conversation has having my daughter this morning. It's just like, you know, being upset about something going on our life or maybe you don't like whatever's is happening at the moment it's just like, that isn't an everyday thing. You were concerned and worried about this today. I was like, you just have to really I actually quoted the podcast. I go problems are just opportunities and workloads. It gives you an opportunity to use your brain to solve it. But don't think that because you solve this problem or now you've overcome whatever's it's taking place in your life. That that is the end is highly likely, and a near certainty that you'll always just have another problem the next day or next week. Life. We always see me on the podcast. You and I always talk about the business problems and that companies are just effective problems solving machines. Life is problems. Everybody has problems in their lives. So the point Trying to make to her is it's like, you shouldn't try to eliminate problems completely because that's futile. You should just get good at problem solving. And then if you enter every day, is it's like, okay. Well most looks likely gonna encounter something today that I don't like, Are there may be a problem. They're the rule not the exception do not let it upset you just handle it and then move on to the next. And so there's a small analogy between the conversation of I'm having my 10 year old daughter that Edison is describing the book about wholly damn. How difficult what he's trying to do. And in many cases, I wonder... I haven't come across this in the book. But I I have to wonder, like, he dips out. So he leaves Men lo park, Ghost in New york because that's where he has to do this. Right? And there's a big struggle and then he winds up leaving and getting kinda of upset and selling all Ga stock later on, and then going and doing mining and and all the other stuff that he does rest his life. Right? But I wonder if he could go back and just be like, I should've never left Men park. And whether that's, like, a partnership with somebody else develops it, a license agreement, I don't know what it is, but he gave, like, his life and soul again, and I don't think he wanted to be in new York. And I highly suspect that if you and I could talk him today, he like, yeah, I should done that. I should have stayed where I was because It was happy. And so what I wanna do is get into, like, his mindset as he's setting out to do this. And is a multi year process even at the beginning. He's like, okay, I it out. But then he doesn't really... He hasn't I figured out completely. And so he have, like, a promising experiment, and then he'll, like, have a fall... Like I setback. And when I found most fascinating is this section where he talks about, like, he was inspired by a Victor Hugo novel. So it says the... This is now quote directly for Medicine. The electric light had caused me great amount of study and and required the most elaborate experiments that said. I was never myself discouraged or inclined to be hopeless of success. But I cannot say the same for all of my associates. He was like a man possessed after every reverse or disappointing trial of which there were many. Right? He worked on day and night comp compulsive. 1 of Edison favorite books was Victor Hugo Toil of the sea. In the book, the hero of the book Gilead, described by his neighbors as both crafty and Labor and believed by them to be in communication with supernatural powers that could be a description of how Edison was viewed at this time, because he's already world famous from the the not only was he world... Like, his world famous from the invention of the pho photograph. And then the electric light just takes to, like, other, levels of fame. So they believed by them to be in communication with Super Mario Power set out loan to educate a small steam ship for my reef in the English channel. So he is taking the metaphor that he's reading in the story is as what's taking place in his life in this point. So it says this this hero so sets out, tries to get this reef... Or tries to get the this this ship that's stuck on a reef in the English channel, on which the the ship has been stranded. In his long effort, he must contend against the immeasurable forces of nature, the sea, the tides, the storm to reach his goal. By his courage, his powers of endurance and his mechanical skill The hero of the book assumes for us the symbolic figure. The steam ship that he is bent on saving, of course symbolizes progress. So edison to str on. So Edison seeing parallels with where he is in life with the story that he's reading about actually motivates him to go on. And then this point is just full of very... Like, some of the best edison quote oliver come across his enthusiasm was infectious. At such moments he would say proudly. The trouble with other inventors is that they try a few things and quit. I never quit until I get what I want. And then another great quote, remember, nothing that's good works by itself. You've gotta make the damn thing work. He wants up testing maybe thousands, maybe tens of thousands of different materials for the filament that's inside of a label bulb. And I just thought Edison worldwide search for filament for his light bulb actually lead to some surprising ends. And so it says another agent of Edison was sent to on a similar mission to the West Indies in central America, but he died of yellow fever. That's the second person he sent out. Right? The third person was discarding Frank Mc, who was dispatched from Men Park at Edison expense to explore the upper Amazon, River journey by Canoe to the wildest regions on Earth. Miguel was gone 15 months, the newspapers carefully following such reports of his harrowing adventures. After having survived the hazards of life among the men and beast of the Amazon, Mc miguel at last came back to New York was given a large sum of cash by Edison secretary and celebrated his safe arrival by going to a cafe. Then he walked off in the night towards the west side docks, never to be seen or heard of again. Thus creating 1 of the great police mysteries of the eighties. That is the 18 eighties, by the way. And if you think about it, this guy's gotta pile of money, let's flash back to what was what was Edison where. You're right? Worried about. Right? Gets that wet 30 or 40000 dollars, can't sleep because he's in this, like Ding boarding house, convince somebody's gonna wind up coming and killing him for the money, which is very likely the outcome. Maybe this guy's drunk and he fell off into the water and drown. That back, you know, that we don't actually know, but he's walking around with a sack of cash. He's super famous, and he he leaves the Cafe leaves the bar and he's never seen again. So the story of Edison electric avengers adventures it's just a series of peaks and Valleys, peaks and Valleys over and over again. And 1 thing that Edison had to contend with was not only was it very frustrating if he found like a dead end, and he couldn't get it to work the way he wanted to. He also had to manage the expectations not only his employees, but also his investors. And he was remarkable. Always putting together like this front. And it's probably true that he absolutely believed that what other difficulties they were going through at the point at the time, were temporary and that they figure it out. And I think the best description of this is that quote by Mark Jason, he says if you're starting a business are running start up, you only experienced 2 emotions euphoria and terror, and almost nothing in between. And so that's also occurring with his backers of which is his financial backers, which was a big pain in the ass to Edison. Hope and pessimism alternate in the minds of Edison financial sponsors during the transitional stage between invent the invention and its development. And so I mentioned earlier how he managed and why people liked him working with he was a young manage in twenties. We still that's we see that's still the same case at arguably the most important part of his life, which is when he's in New york trying to make his electrical system work. Right? And so it says to the young electrician, it was wonderful to see Edison working by their side, all cover with grease and suit. What they enjoyed most was his attitude of carrying nothing for what others thought of him and paying no attention to frills and fancy. So what they're talking about was like, New York has the the highest population in the United States is at this point, he is super famous, and he's working in the streets to New York So constantly h constantly harassed, people are falling around, almost like some kind of like, messi character. And when there's an issue, they would just, like, dig up the lines and then you jump in and try to figure out what the hell is going on. And so that's what there means. Like, he paid no attention to frills or fan. This reminded me very much of Sam. And the huge Advantage he had over his competitors. I just re reread that book officially ate at the oil. If you haven't listened to it, It's episode 02:55. 1 of my favorite books I've ever read. But Sam did this where his competitors are in an office in Boston trying to run their fruit company. Right? And he's actually in the fields in Honduras with his workers. Sam knew his business and an intimate detail from A to z that his competitors could only wish to know theirs. And Sam Murray was a very hard dude and a task master. He was by no means easy on his employees, but they respected him because they knew he worked just as hard if not harder than they did. I think Steve Jobs picked up on that too. When he came back to Apple and he's like, wait a minute. The Ceo of Apple Gill Emilio is described as a turnaround, as a turnaround expert? And he's like, how can you be a turnaround expert, when you're sitting jobs said something like, when you're sitting in your office, eating lunch alone on China that looks like the... From Versailles. And so if you compare in contrast to the way Gil worked with his employees at Apple and the way Steve did. Steve was in there every day. In fact, that made me think of this quote, there's a book called creative selection. I did a... I've read it. That I've read this book 3 times anybody building a product, to read it. It's written by 1 of the programmers I worked directly under Steve, But our work with Steve rather and demo to a multiple times. I did a bonus episode. I'll I'll go back and figure out where it is, and I'll I'll leave it in the show notes. But what was fascinating. Let me just read this whole section. Because I think this gives you an indication of, like, what Thomas Edison doing here, what Sam Murray was doing what Edwin Landed did and Steve Jobs did. So reading from the book create a selection right now, Steve was the center of all the circles. He made all the important product decisions. From my standpoint as an individual programmer demoing to Steve was like visiting the Oracle of Delphi. The demo was my question, Steve's response was the answer. While the pronounce from the Greek Oracle often came in the form of confusing r... Riddles, that wasn't true with Steve. He was always easy to understand. He would either approve a demo or would request to see something different next time. Whenever Steve reviewed a demo, he would say often with highly detailed specificity what he wanted to happen next. This is the the part. This 1 paragraph is what made me think of this excerpt when I got to where I'm at in the edison in book. He was always trying to ensure the products were as intuitive and straightforward as possible, and he was willing to invest his own time, effort and influence to see that they were. Through looking at demos asking for specific changes then reviewing the changed work again later on and giving a final approval before we could ship, Steve could make a product turnout like he wanted. That's absolutely fantastic. I can't recommend that book enough. It's it's really fun to read and you can read in a weekend. There's no reason not to. So I wanna bring to your attention. I mentioned earlier, he's like, involved in business and manufacturing that was annoying, so then he reversed course goes to men park. Right? Then 05:10 years later, whatever was, he reversed this course again. This time in the other direction. And this is why I said earlier, I have a feeling that he should've stayed him, or he he would have... If you could ask him now he he would say, you know, I should stayed him mental park because really what I'm about to reach you is, like, this is a sign that you picked the right profession. And he says he could pretend that he was giving up inventing for some years because of the pressure of business affairs. So that is the actual making, like, he invented the electrical lights now how do you, like, actually scale the company and do all that stuff. Right? So that's what he's talking about. Like, they're there... Now he's not inventing anymore, and now he's doing, like, the practical application or the business application of his invention, I guess. But he could no more stop observing things or experimenting, then he could stop breathing. So that line is why. I think he might have wanted to stay men low park. He could no more stop observing things are experimenting than he could stop breathing. And I think a main theme of this book in the conversation I think you and I are having today is the fact that founders are learning machines. And part of being a learning machine. Is just always being the curious about the world around you. And so there's a guy named Charles Ke. A lot of founders I talked to don't actually know who he is. I did a podcast on a long time ago It's episode number 01:25. The reason he is important to study, is because he was called the twentieth century Ben Franklin. If that picture interest go back and listen to 01:20... Episode 01:25, it was on his auto if I remember correctly. But this is... This is Cat as I've already everybody called him Ke. This is kept now looking back on what Edison was able to accomplish. And I think what he's describing is again, why founders are learning machines and why it's so important to just keep trying things. It was because Edison was always looking for things. As as Cat said, that he inserted a straight wire into an incandescent light bulb and found he could pull a current of electricity out of a vacuum, thus discovering an irresistible source of free electrons. Wanna read his quote 1 more time. It was because Edison was always looking for things that he inserted a straight wire into an incandescent light bulb and found he could pull a current of electricity out of a vacuum, thus discovering an inaccessible source of free electrons. And so eventually, there's this rather dark period in Edison life where that they call the war of the occurrence. I covered it all the way. There's an entire book called Empire light on it. I read it it's episode 83. Edison rather discuss it, so he goes back to New Jersey. But I actually think this interaction that Edison has with the famous explorer, Henry Stanley gives you an eye, who Edison was as a person and what was important to him, and it brought a smile to my face when I read it. Henry Stanley was a stern religious little man who believed that God had brought him safely through the jungle. He visited the Edison Laboratory and spoke a few words into the talking machine. Then he turned to the inventor and said, mister Edison. If it were possible for you to hear the voice of any man known in the history of the world. Whose voice would you prefer to hear? Napoleon's replied Edison without hesitation. Oh, no, No. I should like to hear the voice of Jesus, or savior said Stanley. Oh, well, laughed Edison, you know, I like a hustle. And that is where I'll leave it for the full story by the book.

              "transcript": "\nThere were other notable American inventors in his time, but they were more usually lonely troubled souls, and his personality outs shown theirs. By 19 29, 2 whole generations of Americans had grown accustomed to watching the progress of this self educated man who worked in a laboratory that had its windows virtually open to all of the work. He had known how to drama his inventions. He had known how to gather interest, faith and hope in the success of his projects. He tip the independent loan handed inventor of the nineteenth century heroic age of invention.\n\nHe had begun his work in the age of gas and ke lamps and was leaving it with the cities throughout the world lit up with his lights and music and voices sounding everywhere. That is an excerpt from the book We talked you about today, which is a 60 year old biography of Thomas Edison originally published in 19 59. It is Edison, biography written by Matthew Joseph. Okay. So I wanna tell you why Started with that paragraph, in particular, when I read that paragraph towards the end of the book, it made me think of Steve Jobs quote that we're here to put a dent in the universe.\n\nThat paragraph describes the dent that Thomas Edison put into the universe. And so the way I think about the conversation that you and I are about to have, it's really a continuation of the conversation and I think started back on episode 2 63. To me, these last, I guess this is the fifth episode in a series that I think are heavily related to each other. So it starts back on 2 63 and 2 64 with Edwin Land, the founder of Polaroid, then 2 65 Steve Jobs and 2 66 Henry Ford. And the reason to me, just 1 conversation, that is peer over 5 different episodes is because they all admired and studied each other.\n\nSo Edwin Land, studied Thomas Edison, Alexander Rome bell, who's also in this book that but I'm not gonna talk about today, and Henry Ford Steve Jobs is the 1 that turned me onto to all of them. So Steve jobs talked about how Edwin lane was his hero. Jobs also talked about what he learned from studying Henry Ford and Edison, and then you get to henry Ford and Henry Ford, essentially, Idol He winds up becoming the most best friends with Edison who's, like, 2 decades older in him, but he idol utilized Edison. And the reason I'm bringing that to your attention now is because Edison to me is different than land and jobs and fort. So when you and I are going through these books, when you're listening to this podcast.\n\n1 of the main points is like, okay, This is how they did their life how they how they built their company. What are the ideas? Like, how can I let those ideas influence my life? And that is what I was thinking of as I was working through. This is a 500 page biography.\n\nIt took me over 25 hours to read and actually ingest before I can sit down and talk to you about this. And so as I'm doing so, I like Edison. Like he is wicked smart, really funny, and he gave all of his life energy to inventions that made the world a better place. But if I had to choose between Edison approach to his life and his career and the 1 that Henry Ford, Steve jobs and Edwin Land used, I'm choosing ford jobs and land. Because I think what they did that Edison did not was focus.\n\nAnd this is not a criticism of Edison. I don't think he could. It was, like, go back to what charlie Mu says. You gotta follow your natural drift. Edison natural Drift was that he was curious well, a other things he wanted to work on a bunch of different things at once.\n\nWhere if you go back and listen to the last few podcasts. Once Ford had 1 idea, or? He's like, I just wanna make an affordable car for the every man. And he dedicated his entire life for that. Once Steve jobs making starts making products, his same thing.\n\nHe's like, I just wanna make insanely Products, and then I wanna build a world class organization that out me. Edwin Lynn literally invented the industry that he worked in in instant photography and dominated that industry for 4 decades. And I wanna give you another example. Was just reading Yesterday this fantastic newsletter It's written by my friend, Frederick. I'll link to it below.\n\nI feel a little funny and linking to it below because at the beginning he talks about me, but that's not why I'm linking to it. The entire thing is worth reading, but this 1 section. Frederick does a fantastic job of, like, weaving all these different ideas together. And so in his post, he has this story that warren Buffett is relaying, and Buffet is talking about being a dinner, I guess drinks maybe with Bill Gates and Bill Gates dad, and this is what Buffett says. Then at dinner, Bill Gates Senior pose the question to the table.\n\nWhat factor did people feel was the most important in in getting to where they've gotten in life. And I said, Buffet saying, focus. And Bill said the same thing. And if you think about just from that 1 post, the last 5 weeks of the conversation You and I've been having together. We have Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Henry Ford, Steve Jobs and Edwin land, all saying the exact same thing.\n\nFocus. A simple thing to say and a nearly impossible thing to do over the long term. So with that, let me jump into the book, I wanted read a description of some of the ancestors of the Edison family, which I found fantastic because they're are family full of miss. This 1 trait probably what I admire about, Thomas edison the most. It said, they were a simple hearty pioneering people.\n\nMost of them were short on education. The family was full of dis and eccentric. A marked family trait distinguish them. They were strong individual, often nay say and independent minded to the point of ob. Ob is just a fancy word for stubborn.\n\nAnd so when the author says, hey, they're a family full dissonance. He means that literally, there's a fantastic story. Edison dad had to literally run for his life. And if you think about this, this changed the entire trajectory of his son's life. So Edison dad was part of this, like, ins interaction movement where they were real literally trying to overthrow the Royal Canadian government, And so his dad's name is Sam says Sam Edison was publicly denounced as a leading figure among the would be revolution.\n\nBefore Dawn, Sam was off through the woods, running like a deer towards United States border that was more than 80 miles away. He was hot pursued by the king's men. I don't know why that line maybe laugh, just the idea of being pursued by the king's men. By performing the incredible feat of running for 2 and a half days and stopping only for brief intervals of rest and food, he managed to reach the United States. Why is that important?\n\nWhy am I reading the section to you This line explains that. It was by this stroke of chance that Thomas edison happened to be born in the heart of the American Republic that line is even more important because Not was he born in America but he's born at a time where in America at this point in history, they idol utilized the lone inventor. Edison lifelong fetish fertilization and grasping for as many patents as he could possibly gather was not an accident. It was heavily influenced by the light... By the by the this point in history they happened to live in where people thought that was their way to freedom and wealth.\n\nThen we fast forward to something that happens to Edison when 6 years old, that he remembers for the rest of his life. And so this is how the author describes this event. There's a bunch of people, they were gathering in the village square. Where where they gathering your sea. Sam Edison was whipping his youngest son.\n\nA public chest carried out in anger in the presence of the neighbors and their children, this is a crazy sentence right here. Sam Edison had advertised the event in advance. So it says a public cha carried out cold anger in the presence of the neighbors and their children was something drastic. Edison had set a little fire inside the barn, quote, just to see what it would do. He's 6 years old.\n\nThe public t he received state this is why I'm reading this to. The public t he received stamped itself on the boy's mind and memory. For Thomas described it all 60 years later when he thought back upon his boy. From his description, we have a picture of the boy receiving blow after blow and early in life learning that there was inexplicable cruelty and pain in this world. That part especially stood out to me because this happened to me as well.\n\nI was 10 years old, and I lit a newspaper on fire in the house, and my dad beat a shit out of me. And I knew it had to be bad than the other times you beat the shed out of me because my mom was trying to again get with stop. And that's actually an important point because not that you see it in the books but also in your own life because my daughter is the same age I was when that happened to me, and I'm about the age. My dad was when he did that. And I could never imagine laying a finger on her.\n\nNever have never would. And so that the important point is, like... I understand it happened in their family and up and down the family tree and all that other stuff, but it's okay. It only takes 1 person, but be like, no. That stops here.\n\nAnd I think the idea that 1 person can only change the world around them, but also change the relationships that families have is exhilarating to me. So I wanna move forward. This is very bizarre. This is this is 1 the things I like about medicine. Right?\n\nWhere he's obsessed with jesus just constantly ask questions. Constantly getting in trouble as we just saw, very mischievous, very independent minded. Very hard to control. In fact, on this page where we're I'm about to reach you it says he was very heads strong and will when you cannot have his way. Early signs that he was meant to be an entrepreneur.\n\nRight? But what was fascinating is that he had this life. He just knew He's like, I wanna invent things. And that's kind of bizarre when I'm gonna read the description of first inventor that he ever meets. And so this this guy says this this eccentric person named Sam Winchester.\n\nOften Edison would be found with his nose pressed against the back window of Winchester shop, watching the strange things being done there. The mysterious Winchester was constructing a passenger balloon. So he fills a balloon by hydrogen and he's trying to fly in a hydrogen and balloon. And the reason I think this is so strange is because again, this is the first inventor that a young edison z's. What's about to happen to guys not gonna be good.\n\nAnd as since like, yep, I wanna do that. And so it says he had a few attempts at flight didn't work out, but it says then during the the next trial, mister Winchester managed to ascend into the air, then was waved slowly in the direction of Lake Erie. Never to be seen again and to think Edison like, yeah. I wanna I wanna be an inventor after seeing this guy disappear into the sky. So Edison constantly getting in trouble.\n\nHe's not people... Like, he can't even last in school. So he gets in so much trouble And he has to be homeschool. But his mom does something that so smart and intelligent here. And so she's gonna be his teacher.\n\nSo I'm gonna describe her method of teaching, and then Edison is gonna tell you why this is so important that she did this for him. She literally changed his life. Nancy Edison had superior taste. Believing that her son was far from being dole. So what they're talking about is the fact that he didn't...\n\nHe hated road memo immunization. He was very curious. He wanted to basically have, like, self directed learning his teachers at the time. Like, think about what kind of school he could possibly in, you know, this mid 18 hundreds. And I think they're in Rural Ohio.\n\nWell, basically, his his teachers misinterpreted his own, like, will for self directed learning as, you know, maybe this boy stupid. So her... His mom was like no, I I know my son, I think he's 12 at this time. And she's like, no, I'm pretty sure he's not stupid. So it says, she she believed that her far...\n\nHer son was far from Do. And she had unusual reasoning powers. She read to him from such books as the decline in fall of the roman Empire, the history of England and then from literary classics ranging from Shakespeare to Charles Dickens. He grew fascinated. Oh, he's actually 9.\n\nHe's even younger and I thought. He grew fascinated, and at age 9 was inspired to read such books himself. He became a very rapid reader. This is 1 of my favorite things about Edison. Later on I'm gonna have highlight for you where he's not making a lot of money.\n\nI think he he he has to buy a subscription to a library. Right? And I think that... This subscription to the library equates to, like, 2 day, 2 full days of work. And there's no such thing as an 8 hour day.\n\nAt its point history. He's working like from the time the sun rises to coming back, like, 10 and a 10 at night, and he's, like, 11. And so when he goes to the library. It's not like, okay. I'll just pick out some books.\n\nHe reads the entire library. Every book, all of them. It's incredible. So I'll get there in a minute. She brought another book on physical science, which was called the school of natural philosophy this book changes his, he's got a few books that changed his life.\n\nThis is the first 1, which is described an illustrated very scientific experiments that could be performed at home. The boy had truly caught fire. He read and tested out every experiment in the book. All of his pocket money went for chemicals purchased at the pharmacist for experiments. Thus his mother, and this is the important part the reason I'm reading this entire section to.\n\nThus his mother had accomplished that, which all truly great teachers do for their pup pupils. She brought him to the stage of learning things for himself, learning that which most amused and interested him. And she encouraged him to go on in on that path. It was the very best thing she could have done for this singular boy, a amen at that, and he he sums us up for you and I. She let me follow my bent.\n\nSo at 1 point in of childhood, his father of prosperous his business. There's was a lot of ups and downs. This is now the down where his father's not doing well. I think he might have even lost the business. So this is where he starts to work at 12 years old.\n\nThis is actually gonna change his life. So... Okay. He's gonna actually save a young... He's gonna work in the railroad.\n\nHe's gonna work on a train. And the reason and I'll get to this in a minute, but the reason this job that he gets a 12 is gonna change his life is because he's gonna save a young boy's life. I think the kid was, like, 3 years old. He was like, on a train track and edison some winds grabbing him before he could be hit by train. And in return, I think it's a station masters son.\n\nIf I'm remembering this correctly. The station masters is, like, how can I ever repay you? Thank you so much. And he teaches Edison how to operate a telegraph. And why is that important Because Edison first experiments where I how to make a telegraph better?\n\nIt may... This may sound stupid to you and I are like Silly to you and I? But at this point in history, the telegraph is the leading edge of communication technology in the entire world. The best description in case you don't know what it is, it's just a point to point text messaging system. So instead of sending a letter by horse that gets their 3 3, you know, 3 months later, and then maybe get a response 6 months after that.\n\nYou can send a message immediately. If you were a young person interested in the Cutting edge technology at this point in history, you would have worked on the telegraph. So we'll get to that in a minute. He learned that there would be a job on the daily train for a news boy. So he's selling newspapers, and then he's selling, like food and suites to the passengers.\n\nHe was only 12. And this is the beginning of these extremely long hours at work that he maintains his entire life. He would leave at Dawn and the young boy would return to home at 10 or 11 at night. And so this is the first example of a young edison relentless resourceful. There's all these times where, like, he's writing a train all day long.\n\nHe has to get off and switch trains and sometimes there's like this long layover. Right? And so what does he do? He's constantly into in and out of Detroit And he realized realizes, hey, I have a a several hour layover every day, in Detroit, and there's this fantastic library, and this is the what I was referencing to you earlier. In Detroit during the hours of layover.\n\nHe found his way to the public library. This is Edison describing this point in his life. My refuge was a Detroit public library. I started with the first book on the bottom shelf and went through the lot 1 by 1. I did not read a few books.\n\nI read the library. And so when I got to this section, it made me think of this what I caught... What I told you over and over again. I hope you've watched it. Have you watched...\n\nI hope you watched it 5 times right now. What I feel the best talk on Youtube for entrepreneurs is by the investor Bill Gu. It is called running down a dream how to succeed and thrive in a career you love. I will leave a link in the show notes Anytime I say, hey, there's something in show notes. It's in the show notes in your podcast, It's also available at founders podcast dot com.\n\nOkay? I will leave a link for the full video in the show notes. I will also leave Blake Robbins. Incredible notes on Bill Gu talk. And I'm gonna read from those notes right now, this is the section that came to mind when I read this part.\n\nBill Girl says greatness isn't random. It is earned. If you're gonna research something, this is your lucky day. Information is freely available on the Internet. That's the good news.\n\nThe bad news, and this is why I think the the this... I think this video is so important for entrepreneurs and founders to to watch and listen to over and over again because it just holds you to a higher standard. He goes into great detail. How bad people want. And, like, there's 5 examples how bad these people want the dreams that they...\n\nThat they're going after. And this talk also helps shape my approach to founders. And so let me start this part Over, greatness isn't random, it is earned. If you're gonna research something, this is your lucky day. Information is freely available on the Internet.\n\nThat's the good news. The bad news is, now you have 0 excuse for not being the most knowledgeable and any subject you want because it's right there at your fingertips. That is something Thomas Edison new instinctively. He is 12 years old? Yeah.\n\n12 years old this time. And he's said alright, cool. I got access to the library. I'll read every single book. That's something he does throughout his entire life.\n\nI I have a bunch of. I I'm pretty sure. I'll get home him. I have a bunch of highlights. He just does this over it over again.\n\nAnd when, you know, he's studying a million different fields of study, and he's just like, okay, Work, and I start, he was extremely big on experimenting. But before he experimented, he would just... You would just see him laying on the floor, with like, 50 books on the subject. He's like, I'll just read everything. So let's go back to this fact that he's on this train.\n\nHe's got this job. Now this a few years later. And again, resourceful it. He's like, well, I'm selling somebody else's newspaper for, like, a quarter. Why don't I just make my own?\n\nSo he says he undertook the venture of editing, printing and selling a small local newspaper, which was produced in his baggage car. He sold 8 cents a copy and had a circulation of about 400 people. It was said to have been the first newspaper in the world that was published on a train. So that was a good idea. It's like, okay.\n\nInstead of selling somebody else's product, I can just make my own Here's the bad idea. He allowed another person to influence the direction. So he starts printing, like, personal stories of people in the industry because his friend convinced him that he would sell more. Prom is Edison like a 15 year old country boy. He doesn't know too much about human nature yet, and so this what happens to him.\n\n1 of these candid little stories touch on local figure. This proved to be excessively candid. And so the person he's writing about did not like the fact that his business was put for everybody to read he says, I'm gonna find this edison kid, and I'm gonna extract my vengeance. So now this is a grown man, a grown adult, attacking and beating the hell out of a 15 year old kid. 1 day, the man cited the young editor near the docks.\n\nHe laid violent hands on him and then threw him into the river. Shortly, after Edison closed down that operation. This is the event that changes his life that I referenced earlier, edison noticed that the 3 year old son of the station master was playing right on the main track in the path of the car. He dashed towards the child and snatched him up in order in time to avoid the car. The guy's name was Mackenzie, Mackenzie was filled with such gratitude and express a desire to repay him in any manner within his power.\n\nHe had noticed that as him hung over his telegraph table constantly. He offered to teach the boy to be an operator. That is really important because even if he fell back and he made jokes out of his life, obviously, later on he's much wealthier than he is now. But he's like, worst case scenario I can always be a telegraph operator for 75 bucks a month. It's almost akin to being, like, a programmer today.\n\nSo it says, with him within him within Edison that is, there's a passionate curiosity to learn certain things. So what they're talking about is, like, as soon as they start teaching him the telegraph, you had a hard time getting him up from it. He says he works alone at his experiments for long hours and enjoys himself heart. And so most of these telegraph operators are young man. They really don't don't know like myself here The telegraph operators were the digital nomads of their day.\n\nSo it says, Edison could find work almost anywhere because the need for telegraph was so urgent during the Civil war. These were his wandering years that began when he was only 16. In those days, the strange new tribe of telegraph were generally young men noted for the p nomadic or Bo habits. They would travel light pitching their tents for a brief season in 1 place, and then journey on to another that seemed to offer greater pastures. A few steady young operators rose from the ranks to become industrial magnets like Carnegie because that's what 1 of the first jobs Carnegie.\n\nAnd I think he was around 12 at the time too. So not only do... Are they making good money for their for their age and their time. Their trade is in high demand. And also, they didn't really need much because they just hop a train.\n\nAnd in many cases, they were, like, trying to sleep in the offices where their telegraph were. So that's another trait that Edison would use his entire life. He would just fall asleep wherever... Whether he was in New York trying to build out the electrical system. Right?\n\nOr he's in Men low Park, He would just sleep where... Like, you go to the corner and just fall asleep. Fall asleep by a chair on a table. He just didn't really care. So if for the next few years, he comes obsessed with the telegraph.\n\nThis is the electric telegraph. So remember, there is no electrical lighting before him, this is, like the cutting edge of electric... Like, if you have an electrical industry, it's manifested most pronounced... Like, it's most pronounced manifestation is in the telegraph. And so he's just sitting there constantly getting better at it constantly thinking ways to improve the telegraph.\n\nThe reason that's important is because what he's focused on now leads into everything else that happens in his life after. The germs of many ideas and strategies perfect by him in later years were implanted in his mind when he worked at a telegraph. He described this phase of his life afterward. His mind was in a tool. He said, It was besieged by all sorts of ideas and schemes, the future potential of electricity obsessed him day and night.\n\nIt was then that he dared to hope that he would become an inventor. And the next step in his life that was hugely important was he discovers his hero. This is when he discovers his hero, Michael Fair. And so Edison fired up about being an inventor, but at this point he still has a job. And the problem is, like he kinda neglect his duties to follow whatever he's most excited about at this point.\n\nHe intended to be reserved at this point in his life, he could become excited environment in expo his novel schemes. He would hold forth with undeniable el on every conceivable subject accepting that relating to the prompt dispatch of messages that the company had on file for transmission. So that's 1 of his c saying, hey, this guy knew a lot of stuff. He would speak passionate about it, but he would neglect his work. And if he kept doing that, he's gonna get fired and says his job to him was a dis bondage.\n\nIt was at this time that he bought a secondhand hand copy of Michael Far book, experimental researchers and electricity. Edison said, This first encounter with the great English scientist journals on his experiments was 1 of the decisive events of his life, what I wrote down here. We've seen this over and nerve again. Not only did Edwin land also, Michael Far was 1 of his heroes and somebody that he studied immensely. But there's always like, a book that changes everything.\n\nSo in Lance case, it's that book on light by the physicist would that he would keep underneath this pillow and read like the Bible he said. But what really popped to mind when I got to this point. Was what Buffett said, that the the day that he discovered Warren Buffett said the day he discovered Ben Graham book changed his life. The exact same thing is happening in Edison life right now, and I think he's around 19 or 20 years old. So it says, this...\n\nWas 1 of the most decisive events of his life. This is why. Here at last was the lucid exposition of Far long searches in the field with most fascinating the young edison. And it was steep in the spirit of truthful and humility before nature that was always in Far character. His explanations were simple, Edison said.\n\nAnd then he starts seeing parallels between Far days life and his life. He's was like, okay, There's another me out there. It's very comforting. Michael Far had been poor, like Edison. And though virtually without schooling had taught himself everything too, like Edison.\n\nAnd so check out Edison insane schedule. He he purposely picks the night shift because few lot less messages come in overnight, and it gives him more time to learn. So it says though he'd worked to an early hour in the morning at the telegraph office, Edison began reading Fair days book when he returned to his room at 4AM and continued throughout the day that followed so that when he went back to the telegraph office, he had not slept he was filled with determination to learn all that he could. 2 sentences here that give you an idea what's happening. His brain was on fire, and then this is a fantastic quote.\n\nHe he He loves the word hustle. And he loves hustle. He likes hustling. He say he repeats it over and never again in the book. He's Hilarious.\n\nI've got so much to do And life is so short. I'm gonna hustle. So this is where he gets the inspiration to become an entrepreneur. He is rather crazy for doing this because it's 1 thing okay. I'm gonna sort of business there's a demand for the product.\n\nHe's like, I gotta invent the product I'm gonna sell and I haven't invented it yet. So to describe why this was important. I'm actually gonna read from a different book. So this is technically the fourth book on Edison that I've read. The first 1 was the wizard of Mon Park.\n\nI'll leave all the episode numbers and the show notes for you. The wizard of Men Park, then I read empires of Light, which is about the the war of the occurrence between Edison Tesla and West house. That's episode 83. And then I read, the book Va bonds, which is about the relationship between Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. And that's episode 1 90.\n\nBut this excerpt that I'm about 3 2 comes from the book, the wizard of V Park. I think this is might been, like second or third episode I ever data of founders. And really, I think it describes just what was important to Edison and this is the step 1 in chasing after the stream, having one's own shop, working on projects of one's own choosing. Making enough money today, so 1 could do the same tomorrow. These were the modest goals of Thomas Edison when he struck out on his own as full time inventor and manufacturer.\n\nThe grand goal was not nothing other then enjoying the autonomy of entrepreneur and forest stalling a return to the ser dude of employee. And so his first invention flops, I'm gonna skip over that because I thought this such just fascinating, and this leads to so many opportunities after this, and it's a great example of that maximum that you and I always talk about the history doesn't repeat human nature does. And so it says during the gil age after the Civil War, spec in gold and securities on all the financial exchanges were, of course, greatly dependent on the telegraph. Market quotations were rushed rushed by wire to distant cities and to newspapers all over the world. And so he's identified a willing party that would pay for his adventure, which he's like, hey, there's these things called stock ticker.\n\nThey already exist. I guess this is, I guess I need to pause here too because this is another maximum in that and Always talk about Way, especially at the beginning of your career. Imitation pre proceeds creation. We are all going to build on the work of people came for us. In many cases, the first few iterations of our product are gonna be imitation of them as we understand and we go along and we learn more.\n\nAnd we understand more of what we're doing. Then we get to actual creation. So the very... And that's that's exactly what happens in Edison career. The very beginning is like, okay, there's it's already stock Let me just take an existing product and make it a little better because it's like, there's clearly, like, the people are trying to sell gold or speculate in all kinds of instruments.\n\nIf I can get their information faster or better, they will pay me for the ability to do so. That was true in the 18 seventies when this is happening, and it's still true today. And so that's the first reason I'm reading this to you, the second reason is because he gets taken advantage. This is what I meant about. I'm not gonna call him a cautionary tail by any means.\n\nBut if you looked at Ford, and land and jobs. They always had control over what he did. Edison was so scatter brain. He never did. And so he gets taken advantage of later on, by people like Jay Gold, Jp jpmorgan morgan.\n\nI mean it's not really his fault. I'm not, like... I don't want to think I'm, judging this guy for any means. Like, imagine being in your twenties. And he was 22 when Jay Gold advises patents.\n\nLike, come on. Undoubtedly, Jay Gold would have tied me up in pretzels if that was me and when I was trying to 2. Each still you still me that to me today. You're talking about 1 of the most sophisticated investors and entrepreneurs to ever walk the planet. Let me finish this before I get ahead of myself.\n\nSo says edison could conceived a number of refinements on the stock ticker, which he incorporated in his own model. This was his second invention, and he acquired another back who would lent him some money. He was in his early twenties, Edison was a whirlwind of activity sleeping little and working all hours of the day and at night. His patent rights were sold off to a large telegraph company, and thanks due to his want of business experience, meaning he didn't know what he was doing. Edison received almost nothing for his work on this venture.\n\nThat is why I'm reading this to you. The early career of Edison is him constantly linking up with bad partners. Go back to what. I came remember of his warren buffett but Charlie Mu said that you can't make a good deal with a bad person. And 1 thing is clear from history you should not expect other people to not act within their own interest.\n\nAnd so in many cases these are much older men. They see, like, this young country bump. He may be a great inventor, but he doesn't know much of anything else. And so they're like, okay, We can take advantage of this guy and that happens over and over and over again. So I think the warning there is just be very very careful about who you're letting into, like, your your work and who you're partnering up with.\n\nBecause after this happens, he's left with no money. So he's in Boston and he's gotta go to new York. He can't raise money for anything. And what's crazy is like, you find somebody that may be... They're gonna make the point here.\n\nLike, there's very few people on the planet than knew more about telegraph, like, the the science and technology telegraph, telegraph, than Edison to at this point. Yet. He literally has to borrow money. Like, he has no money. He's almost homeless.\n\nSo it says the moment was a desperate run. He was deep in debt. He seemed to have gone from 1 failure to another. Step by step, and now his credit in Boston was virtually ruined. There was no chance of finding new patrons or investors for his experiments.\n\nHis only hope was to reach the bigger city of New York. He arrived the next morning in New York with not a coin left in his pocket. And this is why there's such a, a disconnect between the knowledge and the talent that he has in his financial station in life at this point. There were not even 10 people in America who knew the tricks that he had with currents, relays and resistance for the telegraph. His mind buzz with ideas for improvements in electrical communication.\n\nHe described himself as a fire with no chimney through which his smoke might escape. So at this point, Edison 22, no money but to tell all these telegraph people like is very common and all the engineers and everything. They can kinda know each. And so he goes and seeks out this other guy named Pope. And Pope is working in this company called the gold indicator company.\n\nAnd so the gold indicator company is just another company set up. This is really, like, there's a... There's multiple versions of this basic idea in different forms throughout the book, but it's essentially saying that any machine that facilitated or sped up communication concerning this key market assumed immense importance. Remember, this is New York City in the 19 fifties. Okay?\n\nBy the... By the 18... 18 50. Sorry. By the 18 fifties, the telegraph was the prime instrument for rapid financial intelligence.\n\nAnd so that is what this company traffic. They traffic and rapid financial and intelligence. Okay? So he just happens to seek out this guy. Pope Pope is working in this office, and he's got great timing because he's gonna wanna getting hired at this company that's transmitting value information to investors.\n\nRight? And he gets hired by by being immediately useful. The day he shows up the entire system goes down. And Pope who's the head engineer there can't figure out what's going on. And so while Pope and the founder of the company are yelling each other and are all going crazy, you have all the customers like, they're literally the customers like rushing their office.\n\nThey're like, dude, the thing that you sold us, it's off. It's not working. I need this information so they're going crazy. And so it says, Edison had been quietly engaged and looking over the machine himself and soon ascertain the cause of the trouble. He managed to convey to them to his belief was that 1 of the contact springs had broken off and dropped between the 2 gear wheels which stopped the whole mechanism.\n\nFix it, fix it fix it Be quick for God's sakes, laws yelled at him. This is the guy that owns the company. That's about to hire him. Remember, Edison does not work this company yet. So it's like, yelling is, like, fix it and fix and fix it.\n\nSo it says within 2 hours the gold indicators quotations, we're being communicated all over the street once again. And so laws is like, okay, who are you strange kid. How the hell to do that, They wind up talking and then Laws was like, I'm gonna hire this guy right away. Laws hired him at once at a larger salary than he had ever received. And so now this guy got this giant organization that edison can actually apply his trade too.\n\nA fruitful and prosperous period had opened for Edison who now perfect protected a whole series of new devices, mainly refinements upon the telegraph. This instrument was Edison first great love. This is why Keep bringing it up to. We cannot understand the image invention of the pho. The invention of the electric light.\n\nThe invention in many ways of the early movie industry. And everything else that Edison did without understanding this period of his life, everything was built upon this. At this was Edison first great love, the primary invention out of which many other in innovations were to float. That way I just ran over my own point there. Some of them eventually destined to sup the Morse instrument itself.\n\nAnd so they're talking about Samuel Morris inventor of the telegraph, Edison along with Bell. Obviously Bell credited this, Edison try to figure out was like, how can we do a speaking telegraph? That's the way telephones. Is hilarious. That's the way telephones were thought of at this point in history?\n\nIt's like, well, a telegraph will transmit text. How can we how can we get it to transmit voice. And if you think about what it early telephone that is. Really to this day, it's like a speaking telegraph. Now this part blew my mind.\n\nOkay? So you know or you probably know? I did this podcast on Jay Gold. This is back on episode 02:50. If you haven't listened to it, you kinda listen to it When you're done listening to this goal?\n\nListen to? Why is jay gold? Why does this think Episode 02:58. Important why studying and and reading about Jay Gold important because if you asked Rockefeller, who's the best businessman ever met? He said Jay Gold without hesitation.\n\nCornelius is van, who doesn't give out give out compliments for anything. Said Jay Gold was the smartest man in America. And at that time, Van was, like 40 years older than gold. You got to study J Gold. The reason is blew my mind is because in that book that I read on gold, and I'm gonna read many more in the future.\n\nAnd that podcast, I talked about that, Jay Gold became infamous because he tried to corner the gold market. I had no idea. That the person inside the gold indicators company, transmitting all of these quotes on the gold price of gold, the day this is happening was 22 year old Thomas Edison. That blew... I always say, like, it's amazing how many events in history are kind of inter lock and connected to 1 each other.\n\nThis is crazy. It says he was an eye witness to 1 of the most stirring events in America's financial history. So after the whole, like, market collapses. He goes outside, climbs up on, like, a telephone pole. And he's so because he's got no fight...\n\nIt's like, when your financial markets melting down. Right? He's a 22 year old okay with almost no money. I think he's, like sleeping at the office or something at this point. So he's just looking at these grown men losing their entire life's Fortune going crazy, and he can kinda just step outside of kind of like this be bermuda spectator.\n\nBut that's wild. The day j gold tries a corner J gold and for its f. Is it F or f fist. Can't remember his part j j's name at the moment. It did AFF.\n\nBut, yeah, the day that happens, Edison innocence actually, the 1 at the machine. That's remarkable. So there is a telegraph monopoly at this point. It's Western Union. This is the 1 Jay Gold is actually going to fight with.\n\nAnd 1 of the weapons that Gold uses to fight that monopoly is actually patents that Edison, they were actually patents granted to Edison. But Edison is a freelance inventor at this time. So he's selling... He'll sell his patents and and his invention to, you know, basically, the highest bidder, I guess, per s. So he's actually selling something to Western Union at this point.\n\nAnd I just wanna bring this up because It's the continuation of this idea that Edison just keeps making more and more improvements to telegraph stock ticker. And as a result of doing so and keep doing so. I think this is now 2 years later. Are thereabouts, he gets his first big payday, And I thought the description of that was rather funny. And so he's meeting with the people at Western Union says, well young man, the committee would like to settle up the account.\n\nHow much do you think they are worth his invention. Edison was uncertain about what to demand. He had thought that he should ask for 5000 dollars. Instead, he said, can you make me an offer? And then the guy from Western union said, how would 40000 dollars strike you?\n\nAnd Edison was Hilarious because he's describing this later on He goes, I felt near faint. Edison managed to s the s her out that the the offer seemed fair enough. He gets the money in cash, goes back to his, like, little... He's in a ding boarding house in Newark, New Jersey. This is just 1 sentence funny out had to reach to you.\n\nHe sat up all night unable to sleep for fear of being murdered for the sake of his great... His great reward. He never seen so much when he's like. He's like, Somebody's gonna kill me for this. So now We fast forward a few years in the story.\n\nHe's 26 years old, and he makes the mistake, and he corrects it later on when he opens up Men Park, but he's just like, he's, like, trying to invent. He's trying to be an inventor and a manufacturer at the same time. So eventually, he's gonna realize, hey, pick the wrong path and he's gonna change course. But I wanna bring up how he managed because he... The way he managed that when he's was 26 years old, and very...\n\nIt's very much the way he managed her has entire life, and it's why he had a lot of dedicated employees That worked almost our entire lives with him because they didn't work for him. They worked with him. Edison was as dirty as any other work man. I immediately felt that there was a great deal to him. 1 of his employees said.\n\nHe was like no other shop offs. Those men had ever known. He was approachable and yet in the next breath, he was very severe with them, and he was bent on keeping them quote unquote, hustling perpetually. His intuitive powers in his endless curiosity about everything amused and intrigued his coworkers. He showed them an irr irreversible enthusiasm like that of a child.\n\nHe kept his men at work long hours, but he himself would work even longer. Working a bunch of different ideas. But the most important idea that's gonna come out from this period of his life is what's called the multiplex telegraph system. Think about it So it's like, way to send 2 message simultaneously. So it essentially takes the existing telegraph machines and makes...\n\nIt just allows them to send more messages. This is 1 of the weapons gold it's gonna use in his war against Western Union. But it says, Edison Smith, I wanna read this part to you because he's... This is 1 of his most important inventions, and it also reminded me of Edwin Land where, like, he'll just read it all. Like, Edwin Land goes and reads every single book on light and the Harvard library, then he goes to New York and reads every single book on light in the New york Public library.\n\nYou see the same thing that Edison is doing over over again. And so it says Edison methods of investigation were described. As requiring complete knowledge of everything that had ever been done before in such a field as automatic telegraph. Books and periodic articles describing all that these other experiments had done, and, and all these other people had attempted, and indeed, all records of previous experiments and automatic mechanisms, were acquired. And 1 of his employees is describing edison At this point.\n\nI came in 1 night and their set Edison with a pile of chemical books that were 5 feet high. This is kinda what my house looks like. But their biographies entrepreneurs nurse. He studied them night a day. He in is a desk and slept in his chair, I don't do this thank God because I have a family.\n\nBut I'm glad I do have a family because I think I would. And so another thing about edison is, like, the cautionary tale aspect is I think especially, you know, I know a ton of entrepreneurs were obsessed people, and I think having guard rails on your obsession is necessary because you're... It's very likely that you'll over optimize. If the history your entrepreneurship is any indicators of such. I think it's highly likely that you'll over optimize your professional life to the detriment of your personal life.\n\nEdison definitely did that. You know, His kids are in this book, and I don't know if I'm gonna read this to you later or not, but his kids are the books and, you know, we didn't know our dad. He didn't spend any time with us, that kind of stuff. And if somebody is smart and has driven his edison, made this mistake, then what's likelihood that you and I won't. It's very likely they will.\n\nSo again, cautionary tilt to some element. I came in 1 night and they edison with the Apollo books. That was 5 feet high. He studied them night day. He ate his desk, he's slept in his chair.\n\nIn 6 in 6 weeks, he had gone through all the books, made 2000 experiments produced a solution that could do the 1 thing that he wanted. And so this gets the attention of Jay Gold. There is, like, gold a huge like supporting character in this book. I'm not gonna... I think I listening in 02:58, you'll get an idea of of gold.\n\nI'm just gonna give you a couple things from him Mj Gold, had taken over the ownership of this other company called the automatic telegraph company. And he he bought the company because he wanted his new telegraph patents, and this is the instrument that he's gonna use to wage war with Western Union, Gold had determine to force his way into the rich telegraph field. This is very fascinating how he realized it was really important because Gold had a lot of idea where you can... You can identify an opportunity because you have deep knowledge about 1 industry and you see that there is an industry developing in parallel to that industry that you know about. You can kinda get there before anybody else.\n\nI don't know if that was very clear. Let me read this and hopefully it becomes clear Gold had determined to forces his way into the rich telegraph field. Gold began to build up an independent and competing telegraph system whose real object was to harass and raid. Western Union's empire until they'd be forced to pay him his price. By acquiring this company, Gold had also acquired the services of Thomas Edison and the rights to his automatic patents, A powerful pawn in the campaign for the conquest, of the nation's telegraph system.\n\nEdison at this point was completely oblivious to any of this. All he was focused was like, trying to make the best adventure possible trying to make the telegraph more functional and hopefully, build a business around that. He didn't understand what a lot of these, like, Robert Baron characters were doing. And so what I was referencing there, I thought this is a section I was I was actually confused, but Gold makes the point later on the book that as he's developing that it was very common for telegraph lines to be laid next to railroad tracks, but the railroad tracks came first. And so he's heavily invested in railroads, and he's noticing this parallel technology shoot up.\n\nHe's like, oh, I'm gonna dominate the railroads, Might as able to dominate that too. At 1 point, Edison describes all the stuff that's happening in his life that he doesn't understand a strange financial warfare, which is a great way to think about it. But he also learns a little bit about that. And we'll get to that 1 second on the very next page. But this is why, like, it's very highly if you are a young person interested in technology you'd be doing exactly what Edison was doing.\n\nAt this point. It's like, why would you work on the telegraph, And I've tried to explain this to you earlier. I don't know if it was clear, but this is pretty clear. The importance of the telegraph in 18 50 to 18 80 before the day of the telephone, was the mighty impetus it gave to the American economy can scarce be measured nowadays. So the importance of the telegraph, the the mighty impetus gave to the american economy economy can be scarce measured nowadays.\n\nOkay. That wasn't actually very clear at all. That's actually a little weird writing. Basically what they're saying, is that the the entire information economy is running on the telegraph. Just like the entire information economy today runs on the Internet.\n\nSo if you're working on the Internet highly likely you would work in the telegraph at this point. So eventually, Edison has a vague idea of what all these people are doing and why these telegraph companies are are being bought and try to be merged 1 another, you know, because Western Union's kind of relentlessly mono the entire industry. So it says, I'm gonna read this paragraph you, and I'm gonna read what I think you and I could take away it. Although Edison invariably posed as a country boy who knew little about the ways of the wicked world. He had already appreciated how inventor patents, even this is a really important phrase here.\n\nEven without operational value. So he had already appreciated how inventor patents even without operational value could be used as pawns are bargaining measures by money patrons of applied science. If you think about what is happening behind his thinking, he's asking, what is an asset that you have inside your company that is valuable to other people. And so Gold actually gives some 30000 dollars for Han invention. And Edison like, holy.\n\nShit. This is amazing. But again, I think this is hopefully the last time I mentioned gold because he's all over this book. But this is again, fascinating the way that gold mined worked. It says it was said, but at the time when the news came out that Edison had been lured into Gold camp, the stock of Western Union fell sharply under heavy short selling by Jay Gold, so that he that he gained, so gold gains in a single day, 20 or 30 times, that which he paid the young inventor.\n\nSo he used... He convince Edison, hey, I will give you 30000 dollars. Edison is like, oh crap. That's a lot of money. I'll take it.\n\nGold uses that news to drive down Western Union stock. Obviously, he short soul it, and so he makes 20 or 30 times in 1 day, what he gave to Edison. And then I'll wrap up this section just with 1 paragraph because this explains to you and I, like, first of all, edison is 27 years old at this point in the story. But why is Jay Gold in Western Union fighting over Thomas Edison? Like, what is happening here?\n\nAnd so says, why did the great barons contend with each other in the courts for possession of Edison Quad. It was not only a superb invention, but 1 of the most important contributions to the telegraph art and would bring dominance of the great industry to whoever owned it. So the last decade that he's been in York. It has been... He starts out with no money.\n\nRight? Then makes a lot of money then goes down. Is like, there's these peaks and valleys that are that are happening. He's under incredible financial stress. He gets like a payday.\n\nAnd this is where he's like, okay. I need to change course. Now he's almost 30 years old. He's like, I need... I'm getting out of New York, and I'm going to the middle of Nowhere New Jersey, and I'm going to build a laboratory of science at Men Park.\n\nAnd so there's a few authors that have stated that they actually think this... The the his creation of Men low Park was just a significant invention because it was, like, the first of the laboratories to pursue, like, practical commercial applications of research, and that was all it did. And Edison arrived at that just by following his natural bend. It's like, this is just what I wanna do. I wanna wake up, I wanna invent all day long.\n\nNot worry about money, not worrying about manufacturer and then do that tell Tired, I'll take an nap, and I'll just get up and do the same thing over and over again. And so this is a quick description until, like, his frame of mind for doing this. My notice is after a decade of financial struggle he wants to build a library. This is the Men park part of Edison or not library laboratory. This is the Men park part of Edison life.\n\nHe turned back on the threshold of the Hidden world of electronic science and turned back, abandoning these perplexing experiments to devote himself to to other more immediately rewarding investigation. So what they're talking about there is that This is where again, I think the focus of a ford, a land in a jobs is gonna yield superior economic results in your lifetime for sure. He would invent something. And then once he figured it out, he kinda like, jump onto to the next thing. Like, he's gonna vent the pho graph, which just think about it, like, pho photograph is, like, the first way that you could have recorded audio in the world.\n\nHe invent it, and then doesn't try to commercially exploit his invention for like, 10 years and by that time, there's all these other competitors. He's making a lot of non economic decisions, which may be better for the world, but weren't better for his truck. He was by no means a poor person, but the difference in wealth though, like, a ford or jobs and a land had access to. It'd be like 50 times, a hundred times more than than maybe even larger than Edison did. So that's what I'm talking about there.\n\nBut it's is as at this stage his career, he was prosperous again, but he was also determined to bring about a sweeping change in his way of life. This is actually smart what he's doing. It's like, you gotta build a company that Liked to enjoy working in it. He had built companies. He didn't enjoy working in.\n\nHe must at all cost quit business he said and manufacturing and live in some quiet retreat where he could give himself entirely to the vocation he loved. Invent research. So that is the why behind Men low park. And then a few pages later, I write. This is interesting and a course to be avoided.\n\nSo they're talking about, hey, why the hell did you set up men parking in the little nowhere? And... Because to Edison, like, why do you need distractions? So he brings people out there? They'd build like, little houses they like a little scientific community, but there's nothing for, like, the wives and the kids to do.\n\nAnd so it says this became a community devoted to experimental science. What would these people do to entertain themselves here in the quiet back water? They would invent things. Edison said. And after that, they would invent more things.\n\nSo I gives you a perfect insight to, like, what was important to him not realizing that other people were not gonna share his obsessive 24 7 nature on inventing. Now, he is also a very charismatic person. And so he's able to convince people to share his mission, but also in many cases, it actually goes against what's actually good for them. And so this is what I mean when I got to this section I was like u, nope. Not doing this.\n\nJohn Ot, who served under Edison for half a century, at the end of his life described the sacrifices as some of Edison old coworkers workers had made and commented on their reasons for doing so. My children grew up without knowing their father. He said, When I did get home at night, which was seldom, they were in bed. Why did you do it? He was asked?\n\nBecause Edison made your work interesting. He made me feel that I was making something with him and that I wasn't just a work man. And then in those days, we all hope to get rich with him. So this is more about Men Park and why Edison did this, and he he loved it. The years at at Men Park from 18 76 to 18 81, by odds, the happiest and most fruitful Edison life.\n\nHe was in his early thirties, and at the very height of his creative powers. The business of inventing was humming along. He was in a happy condition of being a liberty to absorb himself in a whole variety of inviting studies. Here, he could allow himself to meditate, permit his mind to wander even a play without fear of interruption. When he wished to inform himself on some special subject of moment to him, he would gather together a great mass of books, lay them out on the floor, fling himself down among them and then pour over them for hours on end.\n\nAfter which he would go back refreshed to the manual part of his task. And so 1 thing he works on is he actually finds a way to record voice and then replay it back at a later time. This event eventually can take form in a product called the pho photograph, but he also had, like a primitive way to actually transmit human voice over long distance, and it was actually under the heading in his notebooks of something called the telephone repeater. The most interesting part of this section though is not that. What's most interesting is that who he tried to sell this technology to and why they would not buy it.\n\nSo he says he approached Western Union people with the idea of reproducing and recording the human voice, but they saw no conceivable use for it, and there's an exclamation point at the end of that sentence by the author. And so you think about this? It's like, Western Union was a telegraph monopoly. They did not wanna believe or maybe was impossible for them to believe. This is really a a less of human nature if you think about it.\n\nSo they don't wanna believe or they don't wanna see or maybe they can't see anything that would disrupt that. So if you're inventing something or your new product renders another product obsolete, probably the worst place to go and sell that product is a person that has economic incentives that your product does not continue. I talked about this on Episode 200 with James Dyson because he's like, what the hell going on here. I built a technologically superior vacuum. I go to the vacuum cleaner companies, and they don't even see it.\n\nThey're like, this is crap. And he realized like, oh, my vacuum is bag. It does not have a bag and these dudes, sell 500000000 dollars with of bags every year. Of course, they don't want. They can't see what is against their economic incentives.\n\nSo that's where we realized. Like, I gotta do this myself. So this is when he invent the pho photograph. I'm gonna skip over that part because what he does is he sets it aside. So it's like the lack of focus are a different area of focus.\n\nI guess, 1 way to think about it. And he starts getting this idea that he's eventually gonna event which is the electric light bulb. Right? And this is 1 way to describe that. 1 undertaking particularly gripped his imagination, it was described as being that of dispel night with its darkness from the arena of civilization, dispel night with its darkness from the arena of civilization is what you and I call the electric light.\n\nSo Edison is gonna need a ton of money to build out the entire electrical system. Right? And so he's gonna link up with Morgan and van and all these other people in a minute. But I wanna pull out something that was very interesting. It has mentioned a few times previous in the book, but I hadn't drawn your attention to it.\n\nAnd it's the fact that it says he had an heir of supreme confidence with which he sought to impeach everyone around him, including interested capitalists. So he was very good at selling others on his ideas, including selling people like investors on the fact that hey, you should give me money, to pursue this invention because we can turn it into a company. And the note of myself on this page is passion is infectious. Danny Lu 500000 dollar check story. So Danny Lu is was the cofounder of Aka I, and I read his biography years ago.\n\nIt's called no better time. And the reason this came up now is because Danny Lu is also widely believed to be the first person killed in the 09:11 attacks. He was in first class on 1 of the planes stood up to try to do something when they were hijacking and who stabbed to death. He was only 31. But in his biography, it talks about that he completely believe in what he was doing.\n\nAnd once you believe in something, it's easy to transfer that belief to other people. So Just wanna read a section from this book called no better time. And it says stunned by what he saw Lou at the whiteboard, free. This is a investor said he felt a familiar sensation. The same 1 he experienced when he watched some of his top musical talents at the start of their careers.\n\nDanny was like ambition and Intellect on steroids he said. His belief in this thing was so profoundly convincing that I believed too. So that's what I meant about the transferring of the belief, which is extremely powerful, which is exactly what is happening in this... Where we are in the book with Edison. Right He's transferring his belief in electric light to people that he needs help with.\n\nRight? On the spot freeze pulled out a checkbook and handed Danny a check for a half a million dollars. And when I read that book 4 years ago whenever it was, the note of myself from there was passion was worth half a million dollars and more. And see so you go back to the Edison book, he had an heir of supreme confidence with which he sought to imp everyone around him including interested capitalists. And so this is when he starts partnering up with Van.\n\nThis is Van built Son, because Cornelius had just died and left think, like, 95 percent of his money to a soul Son and Jp Jpmorgan. There's a lot more detail in the other podcast I did on Episode 83, which is Empires Light. That entire book is just about this point in Edison life. So it goes into way more detail in the book my hand, but I wanna pull out a few things here because I think they're important for you and I'd I understand because he's gonna... You know, he gets kinda, you know, screwed over multiple times by partners.\n\nIn effect, the western Union people were buying rights, but not an existing invention, but in an unknown quantity, a promise. Edison said. Their money was invested in confidence in my ability to bring it back again. Undoubtedly, these financier were risking, we're taking risk with their capital, though, for such for as people's as wealthy as the Van belt, so at the time was a Richest man in America, it was only peanuts. So it's a collection of very rich people he's raising money from.\n\n1 is the Van built, Jp jpmorgan the 1 organizing all this, which I get to a minute, but at some of them were also, like, the founders and executives in Western Union who are extremely rich at the time. Behind this whole venture stood Jp jpmorgan, who kept his name off the board of directors, but had its partner serving as director of the new company, and they also made it the company bank with Morgan's firm. So his name might be off of it, but he is very much in control. Edison believed that the chances of ultimate success of his project were fast greater because of the Morgan connection. The launching of the Edison electric light company by such sponsors is noteworthy also that it ina a phase of increasingly close close relations between big big and technology in this company.\n\nSo how think about Great is this. Remember the words that you and Are talking about right now, they were written in 19 59. And he's like, this is a phase of increasingly close relations between big business and technology in the company. Are shooting in the country. Even more so today.\n\nAnd so before I move ahead, I wanna read this section from Empire's light because this is how this story ends. And so it was that Jp jpmorgan whose house had been the first in New York to be wired for electricity by Edison, a decade earlier, now erased Edison name out of corporate existence without even the courtesy of a telegram or a phone call to the great inventor. Edison biographer, Matthew Joseph, which is the guy that wrote the book on holding my hand, wrote Morgan... To Morgan, a made little difference so long as it all resulted in a big justification, big trust for which he would be the banker. Edison had been in the vocabulary of the times organized, and that was something that pops up in these books over and over again.\n\nWould prey on week, finance financially weak companies. If they needed his money and his... The money of his investors, then he would take over in many car parts take control of the company, combine them with other companies, they... This happened so much that there's was a term for it that term was organized, and that is the beginning of general electric. Book goes on for quite a while, how difficult you can imagine trying to build the electric industry from scratch.\n\nThere's just 2 lines. Actually, I was just having this conversation with my daughter this morning before school. So it says, he seemed to be meeting with fresh difficulties at every step that sentence 1 and then step sentence to, no great n can be obtained without considerable doubt and tribulation. So really, the the summary of what's happening on across these, like, set up like, 20 pages is problems are the rule, not the exception. And so the conversation has having my daughter this morning.\n\nIt's just like, you know, being upset about something going on our life or maybe you don't like whatever's is happening at the moment it's just like, that isn't an everyday thing. You were concerned and worried about this today. I was like, you just have to really I actually quoted the podcast. I go problems are just opportunities and workloads. It gives you an opportunity to use your brain to solve it.\n\nBut don't think that because you solve this problem or now you've overcome whatever's it's taking place in your life. That that is the end is highly likely, and a near certainty that you'll always just have another problem the next day or next week. Life. We always see me on the podcast. You and I always talk about the business problems and that companies are just effective problems solving machines.\n\nLife is problems. Everybody has problems in their lives. So the point Trying to make to her is it's like, you shouldn't try to eliminate problems completely because that's futile. You should just get good at problem solving. And then if you enter every day, is it's like, okay.\n\nWell most looks likely gonna encounter something today that I don't like, Are there may be a problem. They're the rule not the exception do not let it upset you just handle it and then move on to the next. And so there's a small analogy between the conversation of I'm having my 10 year old daughter that Edison is describing the book about wholly damn. How difficult what he's trying to do. And in many cases, I wonder...\n\nI haven't come across this in the book. But I I have to wonder, like, he dips out. So he leaves Men lo park, Ghost in New york because that's where he has to do this. Right? And there's a big struggle and then he winds up leaving and getting kinda of upset and selling all Ga stock later on, and then going and doing mining and and all the other stuff that he does rest his life.\n\nRight? But I wonder if he could go back and just be like, I should've never left Men park. And whether that's, like, a partnership with somebody else develops it, a license agreement, I don't know what it is, but he gave, like, his life and soul again, and I don't think he wanted to be in new York. And I highly suspect that if you and I could talk him today, he like, yeah, I should done that. I should have stayed where I was because It was happy.\n\nAnd so what I wanna do is get into, like, his mindset as he's setting out to do this. And is a multi year process even at the beginning. He's like, okay, I it out. But then he doesn't really... He hasn't I figured out completely.\n\nAnd so he have, like, a promising experiment, and then he'll, like, have a fall... Like I setback. And when I found most fascinating is this section where he talks about, like, he was inspired by a Victor Hugo novel. So it says the... This is now quote directly for Medicine.\n\nThe electric light had caused me great amount of study and and required the most elaborate experiments that said. I was never myself discouraged or inclined to be hopeless of success. But I cannot say the same for all of my associates. He was like a man possessed after every reverse or disappointing trial of which there were many. Right?\n\nHe worked on day and night comp compulsive. 1 of Edison favorite books was Victor Hugo Toil of the sea. In the book, the hero of the book Gilead, described by his neighbors as both crafty and Labor and believed by them to be in communication with supernatural powers that could be a description of how Edison was viewed at this time, because he's already world famous from the the not only was he world... Like, his world famous from the invention of the pho photograph. And then the electric light just takes to, like, other, levels of fame.\n\nSo they believed by them to be in communication with Super Mario Power set out loan to educate a small steam ship for my reef in the English channel. So he is taking the metaphor that he's reading in the story is as what's taking place in his life in this point. So it says this this hero so sets out, tries to get this reef... Or tries to get the this this ship that's stuck on a reef in the English channel, on which the the ship has been stranded. In his long effort, he must contend against the immeasurable forces of nature, the sea, the tides, the storm to reach his goal.\n\nBy his courage, his powers of endurance and his mechanical skill The hero of the book assumes for us the symbolic figure. The steam ship that he is bent on saving, of course symbolizes progress. So edison to str on. So Edison seeing parallels with where he is in life with the story that he's reading about actually motivates him to go on. And then this point is just full of very...\n\nLike, some of the best edison quote oliver come across his enthusiasm was infectious. At such moments he would say proudly. The trouble with other inventors is that they try a few things and quit. I never quit until I get what I want. And then another great quote, remember, nothing that's good works by itself.\n\nYou've gotta make the damn thing work. He wants up testing maybe thousands, maybe tens of thousands of different materials for the filament that's inside of a label bulb. And I just thought Edison worldwide search for filament for his light bulb actually lead to some surprising ends. And so it says another agent of Edison was sent to on a similar mission to the West Indies in central America, but he died of yellow fever. That's the second person he sent out.\n\nRight? The third person was discarding Frank Mc, who was dispatched from Men Park at Edison expense to explore the upper Amazon, River journey by Canoe to the wildest regions on Earth. Miguel was gone 15 months, the newspapers carefully following such reports of his harrowing adventures. After having survived the hazards of life among the men and beast of the Amazon, Mc miguel at last came back to New York was given a large sum of cash by Edison secretary and celebrated his safe arrival by going to a cafe. Then he walked off in the night towards the west side docks, never to be seen or heard of again.\n\nThus creating 1 of the great police mysteries of the eighties. That is the 18 eighties, by the way. And if you think about it, this guy's gotta pile of money, let's flash back to what was what was Edison where. You're right? Worried about.\n\nRight? Gets that wet 30 or 40000 dollars, can't sleep because he's in this, like Ding boarding house, convince somebody's gonna wind up coming and killing him for the money, which is very likely the outcome. Maybe this guy's drunk and he fell off into the water and drown. That back, you know, that we don't actually know, but he's walking around with a sack of cash. He's super famous, and he he leaves the Cafe leaves the bar and he's never seen again.\n\nSo the story of Edison electric avengers adventures it's just a series of peaks and Valleys, peaks and Valleys over and over again. And 1 thing that Edison had to contend with was not only was it very frustrating if he found like a dead end, and he couldn't get it to work the way he wanted to. He also had to manage the expectations not only his employees, but also his investors. And he was remarkable. Always putting together like this front.\n\nAnd it's probably true that he absolutely believed that what other difficulties they were going through at the point at the time, were temporary and that they figure it out. And I think the best description of this is that quote by Mark Jason, he says if you're starting a business are running start up, you only experienced 2 emotions euphoria and terror, and almost nothing in between. And so that's also occurring with his backers of which is his financial backers, which was a big pain in the ass to Edison. Hope and pessimism alternate in the minds of Edison financial sponsors during the transitional stage between invent the invention and its development. And so I mentioned earlier how he managed and why people liked him working with he was a young manage in twenties.\n\nWe still that's we see that's still the same case at arguably the most important part of his life, which is when he's in New york trying to make his electrical system work. Right? And so it says to the young electrician, it was wonderful to see Edison working by their side, all cover with grease and suit. What they enjoyed most was his attitude of carrying nothing for what others thought of him and paying no attention to frills and fancy. So what they're talking about was like, New York has the the highest population in the United States is at this point, he is super famous, and he's working in the streets to New York So constantly h constantly harassed, people are falling around, almost like some kind of like, messi character.\n\nAnd when there's an issue, they would just, like, dig up the lines and then you jump in and try to figure out what the hell is going on. And so that's what there means. Like, he paid no attention to frills or fan. This reminded me very much of Sam. And the huge Advantage he had over his competitors.\n\nI just re reread that book officially ate at the oil. If you haven't listened to it, It's episode 02:55. 1 of my favorite books I've ever read. But Sam did this where his competitors are in an office in Boston trying to run their fruit company. Right?\n\nAnd he's actually in the fields in Honduras with his workers. Sam knew his business and an intimate detail from A to z that his competitors could only wish to know theirs. And Sam Murray was a very hard dude and a task master. He was by no means easy on his employees, but they respected him because they knew he worked just as hard if not harder than they did. I think Steve Jobs picked up on that too.\n\nWhen he came back to Apple and he's like, wait a minute. The Ceo of Apple Gill Emilio is described as a turnaround, as a turnaround expert? And he's like, how can you be a turnaround expert, when you're sitting jobs said something like, when you're sitting in your office, eating lunch alone on China that looks like the... From Versailles. And so if you compare in contrast to the way Gil worked with his employees at Apple and the way Steve did.\n\nSteve was in there every day. In fact, that made me think of this quote, there's a book called creative selection. I did a... I've read it. That I've read this book 3 times anybody building a product, to read it.\n\nIt's written by 1 of the programmers I worked directly under Steve, But our work with Steve rather and demo to a multiple times. I did a bonus episode. I'll I'll go back and figure out where it is, and I'll I'll leave it in the show notes. But what was fascinating. Let me just read this whole section.\n\nBecause I think this gives you an indication of, like, what Thomas Edison doing here, what Sam Murray was doing what Edwin Landed did and Steve Jobs did. So reading from the book create a selection right now, Steve was the center of all the circles. He made all the important product decisions. From my standpoint as an individual programmer demoing to Steve was like visiting the Oracle of Delphi. The demo was my question, Steve's response was the answer.\n\nWhile the pronounce from the Greek Oracle often came in the form of confusing r... Riddles, that wasn't true with Steve. He was always easy to understand. He would either approve a demo or would request to see something different next time. Whenever Steve reviewed a demo, he would say often with highly detailed specificity what he wanted to happen next.\n\nThis is the the part. This 1 paragraph is what made me think of this excerpt when I got to where I'm at in the edison in book. He was always trying to ensure the products were as intuitive and straightforward as possible, and he was willing to invest his own time, effort and influence to see that they were. Through looking at demos asking for specific changes then reviewing the changed work again later on and giving a final approval before we could ship, Steve could make a product turnout like he wanted. That's absolutely fantastic.\n\nI can't recommend that book enough. It's it's really fun to read and you can read in a weekend. There's no reason not to. So I wanna bring to your attention. I mentioned earlier, he's like, involved in business and manufacturing that was annoying, so then he reversed course goes to men park.\n\nRight? Then 05:10 years later, whatever was, he reversed this course again. This time in the other direction. And this is why I said earlier, I have a feeling that he should've stayed him, or he he would have... If you could ask him now he he would say, you know, I should stayed him mental park because really what I'm about to reach you is, like, this is a sign that you picked the right profession.\n\nAnd he says he could pretend that he was giving up inventing for some years because of the pressure of business affairs. So that is the actual making, like, he invented the electrical lights now how do you, like, actually scale the company and do all that stuff. Right? So that's what he's talking about. Like, they're there...\n\nNow he's not inventing anymore, and now he's doing, like, the practical application or the business application of his invention, I guess. But he could no more stop observing things or experimenting, then he could stop breathing. So that line is why. I think he might have wanted to stay men low park. He could no more stop observing things are experimenting than he could stop breathing.\n\nAnd I think a main theme of this book in the conversation I think you and I are having today is the fact that founders are learning machines. And part of being a learning machine. Is just always being the curious about the world around you. And so there's a guy named Charles Ke. A lot of founders I talked to don't actually know who he is.\n\nI did a podcast on a long time ago It's episode number 01:25. The reason he is important to study, is because he was called the twentieth century Ben Franklin. If that picture interest go back and listen to 01:20... Episode 01:25, it was on his auto if I remember correctly. But this is...\n\nThis is Cat as I've already everybody called him Ke. This is kept now looking back on what Edison was able to accomplish. And I think what he's describing is again, why founders are learning machines and why it's so important to just keep trying things. It was because Edison was always looking for things. As as Cat said, that he inserted a straight wire into an incandescent light bulb and found he could pull a current of electricity out of a vacuum, thus discovering an irresistible source of free electrons.\n\nWanna read his quote 1 more time. It was because Edison was always looking for things that he inserted a straight wire into an incandescent light bulb and found he could pull a current of electricity out of a vacuum, thus discovering an inaccessible source of free electrons. And so eventually, there's this rather dark period in Edison life where that they call the war of the occurrence. I covered it all the way. There's an entire book called Empire light on it.\n\nI read it it's episode 83. Edison rather discuss it, so he goes back to New Jersey. But I actually think this interaction that Edison has with the famous explorer, Henry Stanley gives you an eye, who Edison was as a person and what was important to him, and it brought a smile to my face when I read it. Henry Stanley was a stern religious little man who believed that God had brought him safely through the jungle. He visited the Edison Laboratory and spoke a few words into the talking machine.\n\nThen he turned to the inventor and said, mister Edison. If it were possible for you to hear the voice of any man known in the history of the world. Whose voice would you prefer to hear? Napoleon's replied Edison without hesitation. Oh, no, No.\n\nI should like to hear the voice of Jesus, or savior said Stanley. Oh, well, laughed Edison, you know, I like a hustle. And that is where I'll leave it for the full story by the book.
