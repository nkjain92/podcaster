  "transcript": "This book is not written as a personal history, but as a business story. I've tried to find myself to matters of instructive interest. The chief object behind every episode is to offer helpful suggestions to those who will follow me. And to save them some of the midnight grouping, which I did. Any man who by a lifetime of excessive application learns more about anything than others owes a statement to successors. The results of research should be recorded. Every pioneer should blaze his trail. That is all I've tried to do. My only claim for credit is that I have probably worked twice as long as anybody else in this field. I have lived for many years in a vortex of advertising. Naturally, I learn more from experience than those who've had a lesser chance. Now I want that experience so far as possible to help others avoid the same difficult climb. I sat down these findings solely for the purpose of aiding others to start far up the heights I scaled. There is nothing to be gained for myself, save the satisfaction. Had someone set down a record like this when I began, I would have blessed him for it. Then with the efforts I hear described, I might have attained some peaks in advertising beyond any of us now. May I live to see others do that? That is Claude Hopkins subscribing the why behind writing his auto, and that's an expert from the, I'm gonna talk you about today, which is my life in advertising. Written by Claude Hip Hopkins. Okay. So before I jump back into the book, let me quickly tie this into everything else we've been learning last week Did another biography on David Og, David talks about all the people that influenced his career, all the ideas that he picked up from people that came before him that he applied to his to his work and founding his company. And 1 of those is Claude Hopkins. And he says in in his own books, the ones he wrote as well that you should read the auto of claude Hopkins and you should read scientific advertising by Claude Hopkins. He says, in fact, on scientific advertising, he says you should read it 7 times. They are both very old books. Scientific advertising was first published in 19 23, but it was held secret for 20 years because they thought, the the person that owned the firm that Claude worked for. That the information was too valuable. So it's over a hundred... Almost a hundred 20 years old. And then this auto was published in 19 27. I read both books to prepare for this podcast. I'm gonna work solely from his auto. If you wanna read both books, I would recommend reading scientific advertising first, use it as a reference and then read the auto to see how those lessons are applied. I think that's a smart move. So let me go ahead and jump into the introduction. This is... These these books have been published many many times. Scientific advertising alone is sold over 8000000 copies. So I wanna talk about praise for his auto that comes all the way for... Back from 19 46. And let me read this quote to you. He says there are a few pages in my life in advertising, which do not repay careful study and which do not merit re reread. Before your eyes, a successful advertising life is lived with all that went to making it successful. The lessons taught are taught exactly as they were learned. They are dish up dripping with life. It is not a book. It's an ex experience. And experience has always been the great teacher. Okay. So that's a good overview of why reading this book is beneficial Before I get into some of the lessons from his career. I wanna start with his early life. Oh, let me stop for a second in case you don't... If you've never come across claude how ever, He's widely known is probably the greatest copywriter of all time. He was so good at his profession. He had such an obsession and dedication to his craft that he winds being recruited by Albert Las. Who was 1 of the greatest advertising founders of all time. And he was paid around... What will be equivalent about 4000000 dollars a year. On the basis of how good he was at writing ads that sold products. So that's a that's why he's worthy of study. He was arguably, you know, the best of his of his kind in excuse me, the best of his time rather. Okay. So let me go ahead and jump into his early life. He says, boys, they say gain most of their qualities from their mothers. Certainly, I inherited from mine cons conservatism. The lack of that quality has wrecked more advertising men, more businessman than anything else I know. That fact will be emphasized again and again in this book. I stress it here in tribute to the source of my prudence. Safety first has always been my guiding Scott my guiding star. A Scott Scottish mother is the greatest asset. A boy can have who desires a career in advertising. Then economy and caution are instinct with him. Their fundamentals. Success saved by accident is impossible without them. So what he's referencing there is in advertising. Some people will spend large amounts of money without actually knowing if they're effective or not. His claude... Mo Opera is he does a lot of small tests, he wants to prove that it it's effectiveness before doing it on a large scale. And then once you prove its effectiveness, you bet heavy. So he says, let's go back to his... The influence of his mother. His mother plays a large role. He wants to becoming alienate from her later on because she's religious fundamentalist. And when he admits that he doesn't show her view. She says stuff like, oh, you're never no longer my son. And he was largely raised by his mother, his his father dies, I think when he's 9 years old. But even though at the time he's writing this book, his mother's long dead, he was alienate from her, he talks about learning most of the values of his career that he uses to apply in his career advertising came from her. And this is about his mother teaching him industry, and he specifically references that she did the work of 3 or 4 women. So it says because of my mother... Because of my mother, a dime to me has always looked as big as a dollar. Not my dimes only, but the the other fellow dimes as well. So he's referencing, obviously, when your businesses are hiring him to do their advertising spend. So just as he's gonna be frugal, and make sure he's getting value for his own money, he does the same thing clients. I have spent them carefully, both as an owner and a trustee. I have never gamble in a large way, where they're acting for myself or for others. So the failures I I've made and there are many have never counted strongly against me. I have escaped a dis trust en gender by cons disaster. When I lost, I lost little in money and nothing in confidence. When I won, I often gained millions for my client and a wealth of prestige for myself. That I largely owe to my mother. I owe her vastly moore. She taught me industry. I can scarce remember an hour, a night or day when mother was not at work. She was a college graduate with great intellectual powers. There came a time when as a widow, she had to support her children by teaching school. Before and after school, she did the house work. In the evenings, she wrote kindergarten books for schools. When vacation came, when vacation came, she tram from school to school to sell them. She did the work of 3 or 4 women. She developed 3 or 4 careers. From my earliest years under her direction and incentive, I did likewise. I have supported myself since the age of 9, and he using that age, that line of d as as a time when he had to scored himself because of his father passing away. It says other boys who he talked about. I went to school, but I I didn't use that as... That was just my day. That was just 1 thing that it had to do, but I had to work as well. He says, and then he's gonna compare and contrast. His approach at a young age to to other boys that were his same age. Other boys went when they went to school, I did, counted their school work as a day. It was an incident to me. Before school, I opened 2 school houses opened the doors for 2 school houses built the fires and desks the seats. After school, I swept those school houses. Then I distributed a newspaper to 65 homes before supper. On Saturdays, I scrubbed the 2 school houses and distributed bills. He uses the word bills a lot in the book. He he means, like flyers, like, at ads. On Sundays, I was a church jan, which kept me occupied from early morning until 10:00 a night. In vacations, I went to the farm where the working time was 16 hours a day. So he's doing this out of necessity. He talks about a lot in the book, the benefits of growing up poor. And there's 2 benefits that he references over and nerve again about growing up poor. 1, it taught him how to work up really hard. Which he applies even when he didn't have to. And 2, it taught him how normal average people thought. And he says that's... That was his group... The fact that he grew up poor, the fact that he grew up around the masses. He goes, like, the 95 percent. Is why he he understood how they thought, which And so we... If you understand how somebody thinks, you can sell to them as well. And that is also how he thinks about advertising. He's credited with the bet what many people consider the best description of advertising, which is salesman ship and print. It's not not does not look at advertising as a way to entertain you. I'm trying to sell a product to you, and I need to know if if my efforts are effective or not. Okay. So, I guess I ran over from my own point here because he's gonna talk about this work ethic that he inherited from his mother. Stays with him for the rest of his life. In year... And after years, I did the same in business. I had no working hours. When I ceased before midnight, that was a holiday for me. I often left my office at 02:00 in the morning. Sundays were my best working days because there were no interruptions. For 16 years after entering business, I rarely had an evening or a Sunday not occupied by work So let me pause right here in the in the middle of this. 1 thing to 1, I think beneficial thing that I learned from Meetings booked. I'll tell you up upfront. He didn't really have any other interests besides advertising. He was obsessed by it. And so that's why it's beneficial reading his auto about because very few people are gonna put as much time and effort as he did. Not saying that we wanna replicate this. In fact, he talks about in this book openly, and I'll share with you later, you know, doubting, did I make the right decision. You know, I look around I see other people that that had a lived lived more balanced life. And he at towards the end, he he dies about 5 years after he writes this book. You know, he does arrive the the fact that he was content with the way he lived his life because he thought it was true to himself, but he does see the value in other you know, the choice of other lifestyles, which I found really interesting. So he said says, oh, I guess, I'm gonna run remember this point too. I am not advising others to follow my example. I would not advise a boy of 9 of mind to do so. Life holds so many other things more important than success. That work in moderation probably brings more joy. So how do how I summarize that section? I worked all the time, I would not advise my son to do the same. There is a... There's some difference in brains, of course, but it is not so important as the difference in industry. Now, this is a very interesting takeaway. I'm gonna write this is my note. I'll I'll read my note you first before I detection because That might, help understand at least my interpretation of what's happening in at this point in the book. Maybe you pity successful. Not envy. There is some difference in brains, of course, but it is not important as the difference in industry. The man who does 2 or 3 times the work of another learns 2 or 3 times as much. He makes more mistakes and more successes and he learns from both. If I had gone higher than others in advertising are done more, the fact is not too to exceptional mobility, but to exceptional hours. Now, that makes sense. Okay? If you wanna learn faster. We sell this with Larry Miller, it takes this job at a at a working at the counter at an auto parts store and he did that because and he worked from open to close because he's like I need to learn fast and the way to learn fast is by exposing yourself to more successes and more failures. This is Claude Hopkins saying that, you know, a hundred years ago. But that makes sense. You put in more time. You have more experience you're can learn more. Okay? But this... How he ends this section was a surprising part. It means that a man has sacrificed all else in life to excel in this 1 profession. It means a man to be pit rather than En perhaps. Now, I appreciate that he used... He ended with that 1 word perhaps because it leaves... It open to interpretation. If I... Based on reading both of his books. If I think my opinion if we could read bring Claude Hopkins back from the dead and ask him, would you do anything different? I don't think he'd do much different? Because, yes, he did work a lot, Yes, he did make sacrifices for do. He also worked remotely. Worked from home for a large part of his career. And 2, he treated work as a game. And he's got a lot of interesting insights, and I would say per perspectives we can adopt around that. So I'll share that with... I'll share more with that later. I'm still in his early life, though. He... This is where he's gonna explicitly talk about the benefits of poverty, which is very interesting. Through through father I gained poverty. And that was in another blessing. Father was a son of a clergy man. His ancestors far back had been clergy. Bread and school in poverty. So this was his natural state. I owe much of that condition. It took me among the common people of whom God made so many. I came to know them. Their wants and impulses. Their struggles and economies, their simplicity. Those common people whom I know so well became my future customers. When I talk to them in print are in person, they recognize me as 1 of their kind in the is something that he feels other the people made the mistake. They start up for. They get rich. They move away. He stayed in the same community. In fact, he talks about later on, having in sometimes because opportunity to present itself having to move Chicago having move bigger cities. He's like I don't like this. I wanna go back home. And towards the end of the book, his insights on the benefit, he's got really beautiful writing, but also beautiful insights towards the end of the book, but the benefit of living, which is, I don't even know if I share his I wouldn't live in the same place my whole life. But the fact that he did or towards the end, maybe the first third of his life, he lived the same place then he had to go on to seek opportunity and then finishing the last maybe third or or 40 percent of his life or whatever it was, gave him insights into potential other outcomes of his life based on different decisions. So I don't wanna say anymore until I get there because of writing. So just amazing. It's really beautiful writing there. So let me go back to this. So saying, hey, I didn't make the mistake I was surrounded by... I grew up with these people, I stayed around them my whole life. And as a result that I understood them deeply, and I use those insights and applied it to to be better at work. It's essentially what he's telling us there. I'm sure that I could not impress the rich for I do not know them. I have never tried to sell what they buy, and it's very interesting that he says that because he's unbelievably rich when he's writing those words. Okay. So let me continue around along this line, he he talks about this a lot. But in millions of humble homes, the common people will read and buy. They will feel that the writer knows them, and they and and and they in advertising form 95 percent of our customers. Top poverty, I owe many experiences which taught me salesman ship had it not been for poverty, poverty, I would not have been a house to house camera. So Door to door salesman. It's the word... He uses the word house house camera, but that's what he means. And there I learned the most I know about human nature as I applied as applied to spending money. So a summary of that section is, the been 1 of the benefits of poverty I learned sales. To Poverty, I owe the fact that I never went to college. I spent those 4 years in the school of experience instead of a school of theory. This is also something. You're gonna see a lot of the things, a lot of the hashtags ties today. Is him repeating certain principles that he learned in different ways. And I think pinning those principles in different context is extremely important for us, because repetition is persuasive. It's how we learn. Right? So this is the problem he's gonna continue about the the benefit of not going to college. On the problem with formal business schooling, we have seen this in many other domains. When a practitioner reads a theorist, they usually arrive at the same conclusion and that is the way to think about what Claude saying here. A practitioner, and he's reading theory. This is not very different than when Charlie Mu that calls modern finance education witchcraft. Of course, we we had no advertising courses in my days, in my day, no courses in salesman ship or journalism. I'm am sure we be better if we did not have them now. I have read some of those courses. They were so misleading, so impractical that they ex me. Once a man brought me, once a man brought me from a great technical school. Their course and advertising. And ask me how to improve it. When I read it, I said, burn it, You have no right to occupy a young young man's most impressive years. Most precious years with rot with rot like that. If he spends 4 years to learn such theories, he will spend a dozen years to un learn them, then he will learn then he will be so far behind in the race then he will never attempt to catch up. Okay. So he didn't have formal schooling, but he had a lot of experience and that's where he learns. He also learns from older people, people that are I've that are further down the life path in him. And this is a an example of this. This is really interesting because he learns from a railroad foreman. And I would say this is like, the the the colonel, the very beginning of this idea of treating work like play. So it says another man exert a remarkable influence on my impressive years. He was a railroad section formal. So this is a person who taught him a lot in a short amount of time. He impressed me with the with the difference between him and his helpers. He talked about. He's supervisor, He's the 1 running the crew, and then the people working underneath him. There's a fast difference between the 2. So so the helpers worked from necessity. They did as little as possible. They counted the hours to quitting time. Then on Saturday nights, they would go to the city and spend all they had earned in a week. The foreman by contrast worked with enthusiasm. And this is where he sees 2 different paths, 2 different approaches to work and decides hey. I'm not taking the the the the boring path. The men would go at it stoic and work is the work was a bore. But the foreman made the work a game. That man built his own home in the evenings. So remember when he's talking about the difference between human students, you know, most people, they just go to school. That's what they did, you know, I'm working before school. I'm going to school and working after school and working on the weekends. It's not very much different. This guy is trying to be productive and he knows that being productive, especially his off time is gonna lead him to an easier life later on. I like the idea of hard choices easy life. As opposed to the how most people approached life, easy choice... So just easy choices his hard life. The man would go out at it stoic and work as a work was a bore. But the foreman made the work a game. The man built his how his home in the evenings. After 10 hour days on the railroad, He cultivated a garden around it. Then he married the prettiest girl in the section and lived a life of bliss. Eventually, he was called onto some higher post, but not until I learned a great many lessons from him. And we're gonna get into those lessons right now. I have to say when I read this section for some reason what popped into my mind with something I learned all the way back on founders number 01:25 with the biography of Charles Ke. And in that, if you don't know if he is bio... He's a genius. He was extremely influential in the early automobile days. But he says something in that book I never forgot. He talks about the value Like, yeah, Went to College and. He's like, but the person I learned most from. Was an old wagon maker. And his name was Here sweet. He talks about, like, what you do in your off time. So during his... During the days, Hear making Wagon. But when he has no work, he says he works, he goes to work on Hear mind. He's talking to myself in third person, which is hilarious, but that just that idea that I'm constantly learning, and we live this big, beautiful world, and a lot of us as we age, we lose that child like curiosity. And here in sweet never lost that child like curiosity ke to lose it either, and I think there's a lot of value on that lesson. Okay. Let's go back to this railroad foreman though. So now he's talking directly to Claude. He says, look at those fellows w, discussing railroads, talking politics. The most that any of them know about a railroad is how to drive a spike. They will always do that and know more. No know what I have done while they loved. Know what this is, okay. Let me read that again because this is kinda weird writing a little bit. Even though he's a usually a really good writer. Note what I have done while they loaf there this evening, built most of the porch on my home. Soon I'll be sitting there in comfort, making love to a pretty wife. They will always be sitting on those soap boxes around the grocery store, which is work in which is play. If a thing is useful, they call it work. If useless, they call it play. 1 is is 1 is as hard as another. 1 can 1 can be just as much a game as the other. In both, there is a rivalry. There's a struggle to excel the rest. All the difference I see lies in the attitude of mind of mind. So that's the end of his quote. Was a long quote from the the the the railroad would foreman in. I don't even think we ever are pulled his name. His idea that there's worked his play. Really it just comes down to... The main point of this whole section is, like, all the difference I see lies in the attitude of the mind. What he's saying is the perspective in which you look at things. Think about on Freedom forge, the end of that podcast I did on that book talks about Henry Kaiser. Henry Kaiser, you know, built over a hundred companies in his lifetime, built to Hoover Dam. His crazy guy. But he has... 1 1 thing I looked about him was is just his optimism and his his refusal to to look at the the negative aspects of life. And so at the very end of that book It talks about, they're trying to build. I forgot what they're building. Maybe a shipyard or something like that, and they have to... There's a big storm that comes through and turns everything the mud. And 1 of the workers just crying, Like, look at this. Look at mud. And Kaiser comes around he's like, what do you talking about? Don't see mud. He's, like the sun come out and turn that mud into... Into, like, solid ground. He says something like, see the see the sun smell the dirt. And again, it's just 2 people looking at the same exact, the same exact circumstances, but completely different perspective. If there's another quote. I can't remember which book, It's it's 1 of the ones we've talked about recently. And it talks about 2 brick layers. 1 says I'm laying bricks and the other 1 says I'm I'm building a cathedral. So doing the exact same thing, but there's perspective. The way they approach their work is is completely different. It makes all the difference. So I love what he's saying there. All I see is All the difference I see lies in the attitude of mind, and now we see Claude take from this entire section. He says, I never forgot those talks. And so a few pages later, we see Claude apply the ideas of the railroad foreman. And this is just Great writing. I came to love work as other men love golf. I love it still. Many a time I beg off from a bridge game, a dinner, or a dance to spend the evening in my office. I steal away from weekend parties at my country home to enjoy a few hours at my right So the love of work can be cultivated just like the love of play. The terms are interchangeable. What others call work, I call play and vice versa. We do best what we like best If that is chasing a polar ball. 1 will probably excel in that. If it means check made competitors are getting a home run in something worthwhile, he will excel in that. So it means a great deal when a young man, can come to regard his life work as the most fascinating game that he knows, and it should be. The applause of athletics dies in a moment. The applause of success gives 1 cheer to the grave. Okay. So those are lessons he's still gonna apply way further in life than we we are. We're still in his other their life. I wanna talk about the fact that he's going around placing ads that other the people are making. He's just delivering them to other people's homes when he was a young boy. Really, what what is happening in the session is taught him the value of being able to compare results with inferior competition. And so this is another lesson learns younger as a young boy he's gonna apply to his career. I would offer to place 1 bill, member that were eat 1 flyer. 1 flyer in each home for 2 dollars. It meant traveling some 35 miles. Other boys offered to do the same job for a dollar 50. But they would play several bills in a home and would skip all the faraway away homes. I asked advertisers to compare the results. I soon obtained a monopoly. That was my first experience with traced results. So he's gonna use the word Trace results, a million times in book. It's just saying that you shouldn't be doing anything that you can't prove that's it's effectiveness us. Okay? Think... That's how you think about, the term. He's gonna use it a bunch of different examples and different domains. It's taught me to stand for known and compared returns. And I've urged them ever since. In no other way can real service reveal its advantage, doing anything blindly is fo. Okay. So that's 1 of his main ideas. You need to be able to to trace what you're actually doing. This is another idea he's gonna use over and over again. And it's really on the value of free samples, there's gonna be a distinction here. You just don't give samples out willy nilly. These that's not ways recommending. But when I read this part, remember, I don't know the the number of founders in front of me, but it's the auto automatically Lau, which in my opinion, way too many people sleep on. That book... If you could bring A Lau back from the the grave, put her in, you know, starter her again, she I know she didn't start a girl to choose 40. But dropper her today, anywhere... Like, she's gonna do the same thing. She's gonna be 1 of the best entrepreneurs ever live. Her auto. It's short. It's like you could read it in a weekend. It's 200 pages, but it's large tax, a bunch of pictures, and everything else. And it's just full of fun... Like, she understood human nature. She was very gifted, and she understood sales, and she talks about that over and over again Doesn't... I mean, obviously, she loved beauty, but she be call anything she loved. She would be success fly Reading that book. It just has... It's a bunch of timeless knowledge, and I don't think many people read it. Anyways, she was talk... She talks about building her empire. She calls it the sales technique of a century in her book. Is what I'm trying to to to reference here. And they talk about Anybody comes to the counter, they buy something, and then she would give them free, like, example of some other gift. Or, it caused a gift with purchase or whatever the case is. And then she realized she goes, hey, she she realized was so effective that she stopped spending money on... She's... Instead of spending money when she had limited budget. The money... They they they set aside for advertising, they changed that and actually just spent it manufacturing more product. And that was more product meant to give away. And so we're gonna see the power of demonstration and actually letting your product speak for itself, which is something Claude talks about over and over again. Remember he's writing these words over a hundred and 20 years ago. Still true today. History doesn't repeat human miniature does. Mother made a silver polish. I molded it into a cake form and wrapped in pretty paper, then I went from house to house to sell it. I found that I sold about 1 women in 10 by merely talking about the polish at the door. So, okay. I'm a 10 percent success rate. But when I could get into the pantry and demonstrate the polish, I sold nearly all. That taught me the... That taught me the rum of another lesson I've never forgotten. A good product is its own best salesman. It is uphill work to sell goods and print or in person without samples. The hardest struggle of my life has been to educate advertisers to the use of samples or to trials of some kind. They would not think of sending out a salesman without samples. But they will spend fortunes on advertising to urge people to buy without seeing or testing. Okay. Moving on. Let's go to another lesson that you talked about this is going to echo what is talk about over and Again. Research research research, read more study more, read your product, read books about product, talks about, you know, spending 3 or 4 weeks reading, all these, like, engineering guides to... When you got the Rolls royce account and finding 1 line. You know, after spending what, hundred... Hundred, 200 hours whatever was reading, he found 1 line and he used that as his headline and that winds up producing more sales, and I think, almost any other car for I forgot to dig it increased sales by a lot. I can't remember the exact degree, but it was very valuable. The point is the reading and the research is valuable. So this is more about him on the value research because a a lot of life is counterintuitive. And yet, we go through life, thinking can every, you know, how we think is how we have also to think because it's just not true. She says this taught me another lesson, we must never judge humanity by ourselves. The things we want, the things we like may appeal to a small minority. The losses occasion and advertising by venturing on personal preference would easily pay the national debt. We live in a democracy. On every law, there divided opinions. Soon in every preference every want. So saying, no matter what. You put 1 thing up and people are gonna have a million different opinions about the same exact thing. We don't... People like, I see. What I I cringe at when people say, call things how they are or say it's like, no. Don't, you don't call things how they are. You don't, you don't describe things how they are. You describe them as how you are. And many of people fail Ever learn lesson. We live in Mock... I just read the part. Only the opposite, the bone headed will venture far on personal opinion. We must submit all things in advertising as in everything else to the court of public opinion. This, and why am I reading this because he's saying this is a main point. Pay attention to this. And I like that. He doesn't beat her around the. This writing is very clear and he tells you what to focus on. This you will see is the main theme of this book. I owe here. Here's a little bit of flex for you. I own an ocean going yacht, but do you suppose I would venture across an ocean without a chart or a compass. So now he talks about the importance of studying human nature, and he says, let me digress here to say that the road success lies through ordinary people. They form the vast majority? Demand who knows them and is 1 of them stands vastly a better chance. Some of the greatest successes I have ever known in advertising, were ignorant men. So he's gonna talk about the between somebody being a practitioner and I'm being, you know, theorists are spending their their formative years being educated and sometimes educated in the learning the wrong things. Right? So he says some of the most greatest successes are quote unquote ignorant man. They're are now heads of agencies. 2 of them are now heads of advertising agencies. 1 of them has made much money in advertising. A man can... The same man can hardly sign his name, but he knew ordinary people and the ordinary people bought what he had to sell. 1 of them wrote copy, which would induce a farmer to mortgage his barn to respond. But his every sentence had to be edited for grammar. And he's gonna give us an example here, and he's gonna say, when you find these people, who was... I think was Peter Taylor says, like, you have to find undiscovered talent. When you find these people, you have to hire them. It doesn't matter what their education. You... He clearly demonstrated an understanding of human nature that they have value. So it says, at the time, we were seeking, all the time, we are seeking and advertising men with the impulses of the majority. We never asked our education. We never asked their literary qualifications. Those lacks are easily supplied, but let a man prove to us that he understands human nature and we welcome him with open arms. So here's a direct example of him finding somebody in then hiring them. 1 day, I received a letter from man who had evidently addressed me at Random. He said, there's great demand for ready made meat pies, and I make them. I have named them missus brown's meat pies because people like home cooking. I've created a considerable demand, and I know there exists as a much larger demand. I want capital to expand it. Now here's claude reaction to this. I saw in that man prime evil stinks. His meat pies did not attract me, but his rare insight to human nature did. So I sent out a man to investigate. He found that the writer was a night cook in a shabby restaurant and he was making 8 dollars per week. I brought him to my office, and I offered him 25 dollars per week to learn advertising. He came with me, and he is now 1 of the leading advertising men of the country. So he talks about 2 insights there is 1, like, he's in a position to know that people will eat meat pies because he's in a restaurant. Right? But the the main insight there is that I've named them missus Brown's meat pies because people like home cooking. That is the main insight. Claude mentions over and over again. There's really no such thing as a corporation It's just an abstraction. Right? People like people. And you're attracted to people that talk like people. Not... Yet no 1 goes down reads the writing of a mindless corporate or a fate... So I think he calls at Solace. I wanna say face. No No. He says Soul corporation. So his point, this idea is like, there's a... There's just some dude in a shabby restaurant making meat pies at night, but he calls of missus Brown. They use the same thing. Over and over again, Claude will develop personalities for businesses, based on real people. And usually, it'll be... Even if the person has worked there, like, maybe it's the same model, person you photograph, but you always... That that is becomes the physical representation of the company. He does this for women's clothing. What's the other thing he does it for? I can't remember at the moment. Hopefully, I'll I'll run into it, but he uses example. It's like, oh, it's like it's a guy I do have a highlight on it. I know I. So I'm sure I'll covered. It'll come to mind when when I get to that part, but but just remember that main point. Again, that main insight. It's like, people want to buy from people. Missus Brown's meat pies, to note to the customer, it's like, thinks of, you know, my maybe your mother's home cooking or whatever the case was. Like, I... It's a very strong, instinct in in humans. I guess, this point there. Now, Claude just has some general advice about career. You could summarize this section by, love what you do or find another work. I believe every man should do so. No man succeeds in any line where he finds himself in disagreement and where unhappiness results. I consider business as a game and I played it as a game. That is why I have I have been and still Am so devoted to it. Okay. So now in the early days of his career. He does not start out as an advertising agent. Alright, and it working in advertising agency rather. He works for private businesses and tries to do develop advertising internally. It takes... I wanna say 16 years. That's the number that jumps out to me. 16 years before he finally... Accepts Albert Las being recruited by Albert Las, which he talks about, like, Las per persuasion power was unbelievable. So a lot of the lessons that he's going to apply once he's actually working advertising issue. He developed by working in a bunch of businesses. So 1 of them is he works for this... This standstill still around bi, carpet, bi carpet sweep companies what it's named then. I think it's just named Bi now. If I'm not mistaken. But this is a... The reason I bring this to your attention is because this is where he's discovering a quirk in human nature. Does not have a lot of money he's, like, there's places where you can rent like, a place to live, and they give you food as well. And he's forced... He has so little money He's forced to accept, like, the the package deal where you have to skip a meal or 2 I wanna say, a meal a day, something like that. And so he tries to appeal, like, oh, I'm poor, help me, and he realizes that's not that's not really convincing. That's not gonna... Some people will be convinced by the argument, but the vast majority humans won't be. And so this is where he's discovering a quirky in human nature. I met mister Bi. He's the president of the Bi carpet super company. He was a gen man, and I saw on him a chance to at a higher salary. 1 day, I way him on his way to lunch. I pictured the difficulties of a young man living on 4 dollars and 54 dollars and 50 cents per week. There was no need to exaggerate. There on his way to lunch. I told him of the 2 meals weekly, I was obliged to miss. So it's was 2... He to skipped 2 meals a week, not a day. Above all, I pictured my dream of pie. So saying I just really want to buy. I knew a restaurant which served pie a dinner, but the board was 3 dollars and 50 per... 3 dollars and 50 cents per week. My greatest ambition at that time was to get that pie. From him, I learned another kin in human nature. Struggle and poverty did not appeal him. He had known them as well, and he consider them good for a fellow, but he loved pie, and he... And had never been denied, so he invited me home to eat pie. And this is an important part. He gets this pie, but then he's like, hey, you a job, and he arranged for a salary of 6 dollars per week so I could have pie every day. No oh, so I need to back up too. I I skipped. He's not yet advertising yet. He's being trained is, like, a go for, like, a bookkeeper. And this is where he realized, like, I'm on the wrong side of this transaction. And the... III... You and I've talked about this many times, The way to summarize just good life advice in general is if you're working for a company, stay close to the money. People, they start on sales, they start in retail, they start close to the customer transaction on the front lines, and then they get promoted and they get further away for the money, and then they go from being an asset to an expense. And when times are tough or when a new Ceo takes place or new management, they start looking at this, like, okay. And they wipe these departments out, stay close to the money. I began to re... This is Claude realizing that hundred and 20 years before I did. I began to to reason in this way, a bookkeeper is an expense. In every business, expenses are kept down. I could never be worth more than any other man who could do the work I did. The big salaries were paid to salesman. To the ones who bought in order brought in orders or to the men in the factory who reduced the cost. They showed profits and they could command a reasonable share of those profits. I saw the difference between the profit earning and the expense side of a business. And I resolved to graduate from the debit class, and this is why he could make 4000000 dollars in a year as an employee because he's making his... The business that he works for and the customers of that business way more money than that. He would never make that as a bookkeeper or anything. So now we get to the point where he... He's learning... Again, there's really no formal advertising career here. So he's gotta learn through a series experiences. He winds up... This is like a potential blueprint for him. He wants competing with him This is guy named John Powers. And he sees how much money. Remember, He's making 6 dollars a week. I think at this point. So just over. 300 bucks a year, and he realizes this guy named John Powers, who's really good at advertising. He's making 12000 dollars year. He been advertising... He... He was an advertising writer for John Wanna maker. And there, he created a new conception, new conception of advertising. He told the truth, but he told it in a rugged and fascinating way. Wanna maker paid him 12000 dollars a year, which in those days was considered a fabulous salary. He had become the model and idea of all men who had advertising. So that's John Powers he's talking about. And so in some... And so in some respects today. The principles for which John Powers stood are still among our advertising fundamentals. So why is this sentence so important. Right? So we learned from david Over. David Au says, hey, 1 of my... My... I was a disciple of Ro Reeves when he's having lunch or, dinner, or whatever it was there's weekly meetings with Ross Reeves Ross Reeves is like, hey, I learned from Claude Hopkins. You should study him. Now Claude Hopkins is saying I learned from John Powers. You see how no 1 owns ideas. Everybody learns from somebody else, they still borrow whatever copy whatever where you wanna put on it and then use those ideas in your career. This is so fundamentally powerful. A clothing concern was on the verge of bankruptcy. So now he's he's talking about an advertising campaign that powers had a lot of success with that is very, very counterintuitive. And really he's gonna say tell the truth. That's that's the main point here. Okay? A clothing concern was on the verge of bankruptcy. They called in powers, and he immediately measured up the situation. And this is what Power said. There's is only 1 way out. Tell the truth. Tell the people that you're going bankrupt and that your only way to salvation lies to a... Do large and immediate sales. The clothing dealers argue that's such an announcement will bring every creditor to their doors. But power said, no matter, either tell the truth or I quit. Their next day ad, their next day's ad red. We are bankrupt. We owe a hundred and 25000 dollars more than we could pay. This announcement we will bring our creditors down to our next. But if you come by tomorrow, we shall have the money to meet them. If not, we go to the wall. These are the prices we are quoting to meet this situation. And this is the result. And so they're saying like look at these prices, just please buy from us. Truth was then such a ra in advertising that this announcement created a sensation. People flocked by the thousands to buy and the store was saved. So those an example power being extremely successful. Now the... The carpet company that Claude is working for hires powers, and then power... Claude reading the ads. Like, this is this isn't gonna work. I think I could do a better job. So he says, I said, that cannot sell Carpet sweep. There's not 1 word in the pamphlet, which will which will lead people to buy. Let me try my hand. In 3 days, I will hand you a book to compete with based on knowledge of our problems. So this is this this is writing his first ads. And the way he approaches the way he gets this opportunity because he... It's a very... It's a low risk, so he caps the downside, but leaves the upside, potentially unlimited. He's gonna wind up selling like, a quarter million of these things. So it's really remarkable what's about to happen. So he's gonna he's got attack this, but I was like, okay, can we sell this by mail. Okay? The Corpus sweep business was then in its infancy. Users refute and sales are small. On the strength of my pamphlet, I asked for permission to try to increase the demand. Christmas was approaching on my nights pacing the streets. I had thought of the idea of a sweep as a Christmas present. It had never been offered as such. I designed a display rack for exhibit. I dropped cards. So they say to the queen of Christmas presents. Was the headline. And I went to the manager and asked this permission to to to solicit solicit some to solicit some sales by mail. I sent out some 5000 letters. They brought me 1000 orders. Was That was the most orders we'd ever received by mail. That was the birth of a new idea which led me to graduate from the expense account to the field of money earners. So that's Tim documents. About it's like, I'm getting. I'm on the wrong side of transaction. I'm gonna stay closer to the money. Okay. So he gets his next idea because he has... He's interested in, like, he he grew up in the woods in Michigan, so he'd like to walk in the forest and everything, and he used to gather sample of woods and he would set, like, different kind of woods and trees and sent around to people. And so you had this idea. Like, okay, Well, how don't can we get people interested in things. And I just re reread my highlights from James Dyson auto automatically if fever which was a fantastic book if I haven't read yet. And he was talking about 1 of the benefits He, like, purposely made his vacuum cleaner. Look... And different than anything else. Because even if they don't buy there they're gonna stop, like, what is happening? Seth Gordon, the famous writer marketer talk... It's like, he references this is this shorthand it's like a purple cow. Like, if you're driving down the road, you're used just seeing, you know, black and white cows, they're sitting they're eat... They're saying next to each other maybe in some grass. But if it... If 1 of them is purple, you'd stop like, what the hell happening here. So he uses this idea. Like, okay. I knew a lot about woods and, what they look like and different finishes. And so he convince them. Like, why don't we try to make our sweep look different, and we say for a limited time? I think it was limited time. Hey, we're gonna we're gonna put out 12... You can you can pick a news newspaper, and you can pick, you know, which would... We're gonna have 12 different models. And this is... The the result of this, this is what I mean about, like, why Claude, I think was so so help bent on, like, experimentation because you you derived counterintuitive, unpredictable insights from experimentation that you would never would otherwise. And no 1 would think, okay, we some put some wood. Some wood coding, on much of sweep. We're gonna sell quarter million them. Like, that it just sounds ridiculous, but it actually happened. And multiplied the use of carpet sweep and it gave to Pistol sweep the practical monopoly which they maintain to this day. Other men will say, I have no such opportunity. My line is not like that, meaning my product is Not like that. Of course, it isn't. But in all probability, it offers a thousand advantages. No man is in any line that is harder to sell than carpet sweep were in those days. I care not what it is. The usual advertising was impossible. A carpet sweep with us 10 years. The profit was about a dollar. Never has anyone found an ordinary way to advertise profit on an article of that class because of what he's saying is you... How can you advertise? You you're making a dollar for every decade per customer. No young man finds himself in any field with smaller opportunity. He's talking about the need for cr. Looking at things creatively, doing things differently experimenting differently. Any man in a bank, a lumber office, tire concern or grocery has a far better opportunity than I had. The only difference lies in his conception meaning his ideas your perspective how you're approaching it. I felt that Clerk ship was an expense and expenses would always be minimized. I was struggling to graduate into the profit earning class where no such limit exists. So I just gave you the punch on obviously, this book, it's, like, 200 pages. I highly... I love little small compact books I have a lot of ideas and them. I'm gonna leave a link in the show notes to to the Kindle version because you you buy this book and you get scientific advertising as well. And it's probably like 10 bucks 12 bucks. I don't even know what I paid, but it's remarkable. I recommend reading. It's really interesting. Let me... I'm still in this the section about, about him finally making the switch and and doing so because he he wanted hitting on 2 really good ideas to sell more more carpet sweep. Right? And really what he's about to say here is the leverage that a great idea I can give you. Right? After that, I gave up my bookkeeping and devoted my time to sell I sold more carpet sweep by my 1 cent letters than 14 salesman on the road combined. This is also what I like about this book is that he's... You know, he talks about Was like, it's not, hey, I'm fantastic. I'm great. Look, you know, just... It's not a really celebration of his life. It's just like, this is how I looked at things, and, you know, I could be content towards the end of my life that I I did things, but there are alternate paths to consider. And it's... This is where we see. He's not sure which past is bet... Or, excuse me, which path is best at the time. Because he he tried to get... He was recruited several times, and he pulled him away from where he wanted to be. And he's just not sure about that. So let me let me read this. The the point is that everybody's gonna go through periods of self doubt are uncertain in their life, and then we just gotta keep working our way through it. Right? Now I approach a tragic epoch in my life. I was close to my limits in Grand Rapids. That's where he he like living. This offer gave me wider recognition, ambitions surge within me. I became anxious to go higher. I had built a new home Grand Rapids, all the friends I knew were were there as well. I enjoyed prestige there. I knew that in a larger field, I would have to sacrifice the things that I love most. I suppose I was right in my desires according to general standards. Ambition is everywhere applauded. So he's like, you know, people love ambitious people, but ambitious... Maybe a decision to make to to further ambition is not the best decision for your life. This is very confused. It can be very confusing. Ambition is everywhere applauded. But I have often returned to Grammar rapids to envy my old associates. They continued in a quiet sheltered life. Or quite quiet sheltered fields. Excuse me. They met they met no large demands. Success and money came to them in moderation. But in my turbulent life, as Review, I have found no joys that they have missed. Fame came to me. But I did not enjoy it. Money came, but I could never spend it. My real inclination has always been toward the quiet pass. When my old friends and I get together here, it is hard to decide who took the wiser course. And so the more and read and and learn about the life stories with people. I don't I don't know if you can... I don't know if uncertainties ever anything you overcome. I think you just learned to live with it. I mean, this guy's writing this towards the end of his life. And he's like, in some degree, the celebration of his career and, you know, that he is happy that he was able to master's his craft and and add to and he's writing to hopefully, to to help us if we we wanna like, derive insights for his work. But it's also not you know, the the uncertainty never resolved, I guess, is my point here. So let me tell you what's going on his life's for him to think this way. So there's a company that has 1 of the largest advertising budgets in America, and it's looking for head of advertising. And Claude talking about his ambition, Claude finds out a hundred and 5 other people applied. And that... For some reason, it just... He wants it more now because of that. He gets really competitive. He has dozens of people send letters about his skills as a writer an advertiser to the company. He starts... This is this guy's an extreme person. He starts writing a daily newspaper article for free on the subject of advertising, just so the person in charge of hiring sees it. So he winds getting the job, and regretting it. And then the left myself is how wild is this last sentence? And I'll I'll tell you when I get to last. So says the next morning in... Did... Oh, I didn't... Wasn't clear there. He has to leave grand rapids where he does wanna leave, And I think it's just in Chicago. It's a a stock yard, which is like, a slaughter house. The next morning in Grand Arab, Grand Rapids, I went to my home and saw the family on the porch. There were shade trees in front and many flowers in the yard. He's obsessed with nature by the way. I contrast that setting with the stock arts. Where the outlook covered only dirty pens filled with cattle and hogs. The way of the office led to a half mile of month, then I regretted my action. The price seemed too great to pay. Had I not given my word, I would have turned back that morning to quiet significance. And this is a wild last sentence. And now, after looking back 30 years, I think I would turn back this morning. Now, this is more... It's another him talking about the the importance of demoing again. He says this over and over again. So he says, to many, advertising is placing some dignified phrases in print. But commonplace dignity doesn't get far. Study salesman. Canvas and fake. He talks about learning from people that, like, you know, street performers. That's what he means by my Fake. Fake. Study salesman, canvas and fake. If you want to know how to sell goods. This is his main point here. No argument in the world can ever compare with 1 dramatic demonstration. And I like the... He talks about demos as a form of service. So if you're talking about advertising, trying to give convince people to set to buy what you want. He's I don't start saying buy my goods. That's not compelling to anybody. You start with service. All good salesman, in print are in person is based on some appealing service. Good salesman study to make their appeals inviting. 1 says, send me the money, and I will return it if the article is not satisfactory. Another says, send no money, let me send the article for trial, then remit or return it just as you desire. The the second 1 being a lot better. I buy many books by mail. In nearly every issue of certain magazines, I see descriptions of books, of books I may want. The ads do not say, send the money. If they did, my purchases would be few. My checkbook is at the office. By the next day in all probability, the book would be forgotten. But they offered to send me the book to examine. I simply mail the coupon. I tear it out, put into my pocket and mail it the next morning. Do you see what are you talking about there? Where you're saying, okay, 1 saying send me money. And the other 1 saying, I'll send you something. 1 is... 1 is asking for something. 1 is serving you. Saying, hey, this book so good. Let me go and send it to you. And if you like it, send me a check for. If you don't just send it back. Start with service is the way to to summarize that section. Another main insight of his, treat every ad, everything you're doing, everything you're writing as if the person is standing in front of you, This is hilarious. Yeah the the noise of, I guess I'll tell you that the Left myself first because it hopes to understand what I'm about to read you. You wouldn't hand her a catalog of general products if that person was asking you about sewing machines. Yet to process the business process of this particular company does that exact same thing. So it says, he's doing the advertising for Montgomery ward. It says many new many new merchandising plans were ina graded. My ever last argument was against dealing with people in the mask. Remember in the mask. Not mask. In the mask. Treat everyone is if there's was a 1 person an individual standing in front of you. It's a very powerful idea. For instance, a woman wrote in about a sewing machine. She had that and nothing else on her mind. The general plan then was to send a catalog. That's what the company was doing before he said, What are you doing? Treating all inquiries as if they were like. I urged that every inquire to be treated like a prospect who came into the store. We had a special catalog and sewing machines, showing every Style and price. We sent every inquire the names of all of all in her vicinity who had bought our sewing machines. We asked her to see the machines to talk with their owners. So he's talking about the approach he as opposed to just like, you wrote me in about sewing machines here. I'll send you a catalog. It has sewing machines in it, but it's not dedicated to that. As opposed to I'm gonna send you a catalog that only has machines. Showing every style, every price. Then we show you list to my customers, their contact information. If you wanna talk him about the machine. Which 1 do you think is going to respond to result in the most amount of sales. A lot of what cloud does is just thinking. It's just like, is this common sense, like, are we That's something thing, large problem with big companies it's like they come obsessed with process instead of actually solving problems. There, I learn another valuable principle in advertising. In a wide reaching campaign, we are too apt to regard to people in the mass. We try we try to broadcast our seed in the hope that some part will take root. That is too wasteful to bring a profit. We must get down to individuals. We must treat people in advertising as we treat them in person, center on their desires. Consider the person who stands for you with a certain sprint... With certain expressed desires. However, big your business get down to the units for those units are all that make size. Okay. So now he's gonna talk about the insights he he he derived from writing ads for a brewery. And the summary, the section is, like, what is ordinary to you about your product or your work is unknown to the customer. And if they knew, it would marvel them use it. So he's ghost and takes a tour of the brewery, and he just cannot believe the process they go through to make the beer, and he's like, why aren't you telling the story? Like, because everybody does this. But know what... The customer doesn't know that, and it... What's what's... Again, what what you know about your product? Is you're used to you come used to it. It will marvel your customer. So she says, then I went through the brewery. I saw a plate grass plate glass rooms where beer was dripping over pipes. And I asked the reason for that. They told me those rooms were filled with filtered air, so the beer could be cooled and imp. I saw great filters filled with white wood pulp. They explained how that filtered the beer. They showed how they cleaned every pump and pipe twice daily to avoid contamination. How every bottle was cleaned 4 times by machinery. They showed me a well where they went 4000 feet deep for pure water. They showed me that the vat were where beer was aged for 6 months before it went out to the user. They took me to the laboratory and showed me that their original show me their original mother yeast cell, that had been developed by 1200 experiments to bring out the utmost flavor. All of the yeast used in making the their beer was developed from that original show. So, I came back to the office amazed. I said, why don't you tell people these things. Why do you merely try to cry louder and others that your beer is pure? Why don't you teach the reasons? Why? They said the process we use are just same as others... As others use? No 1 can make good beer without it, but I replied others have never told the story. It amaze anyone who goes through your brewery, brewery. It will start everyone in prints. So I pictured and print those pla plate classrooms and every other form and imp. I told a story common to all good brewers, but a story which had never been told. I gave purity a meaning because he's talking about everybody at the. Was like, we are the the everybody, you know, we all copy each other. And so he talks about, you'll see ads. If you say the lowest price, then your competitors will say lowest price. And then they're... Like, everybody starts copying then everybody ads are the same, and they're not effective. So everybody at this point is advertising beer saying it's the pure purest beer. That's not helpful if there's 7 other people or 15 other beers are making the same claim. Find a way to differentiate yourself, and you have the yourself because you're describing a a process that you use to make the product that would marvel people that don't understand it or... Are are unaware of it rather. So just it says I told a story common to all good brewers, but a story which Never been told. I gave period of meeting. The brand he's working for a jump from fifth place to neck and neck with the first place in a few months. That campaign remains to this day 1 of my greatest accomplishments. But it also gave me the basis for many other campaigns. Again, and again, and again, I have told simple facts common to all makers in the line, too common to be told, but they have given the article first, given the product, first align with them an exclusive and lasting prestige. That situation occurs in many, many lines. So many, many businesses is what he's saying there. The maker's is too close his product. He sees it in his... In his... He sees his methods only the ordinary. He does not realize that the world at large might more about those methods and that facts and that facts which seem commonplace to him might give him vast distinction. And this is a summary of the entire section, tell the paint tell the pains you take to excel. So I just 1... Very concise say sentence, I think is good advice, serve better than others offer more than others and you are pretty sure to win, more on service. There are other ways I know to win in selling and in advertising. But they are slow and uncertain. Ask a person to take a chance on you and you have a fight, offer to take a chance on him and the way is easy. Okay. So he has all these experiences working for companies, and then this is where he's burnt out. He... He wants to give up and take a break for a little bit. And he winds up... This is where he he yields to being recruited by Albert Las. And I think the way Albert Las recruits him is is very fascinating. Gives and say, I have... Last last was biography too. I'll, pop, I'll probably cover that in the future at some point. I haven't ready yet see he's any good, but this guy seems very very unique. So he goes me mister Las. He thinks at the beginning, he's like, I'm just gonna... I'm not... I don't I don't... I'm not gonna accept a job. Just gonna hear him out, but Not gonna accept it. It says mister Las handed me a contract from the Van camp packing company for 400000 dollars. It was based on the condition that cop that copy be submitted satisfactory to Mister Van Camp. Mister Las said, I searched the country for copy. This is copy I got in New York. This is in Philadelphia. I spent thousands of dollars to get the best copy obtain. You see the results. Neither you or I would submit it. Now I asked you to help me. Give me 3 ads. Which will start this campaign. And your wife may go down Michigan Avenue to select any car on the street and have it charged to me. So it's a very unique selling proposition. Albert las are very unique individual, Og, David Og in Ob and advertising says that Albert Alaska gonna made more money than anybody else in the entire, history of advertising business. He also spent a ton too. He's a wild wild person. Once we're doing his, you know, for multiple decades in 1 day. I'm done. Winds up selling his firm to 3 people at work firm him for like, a token payment of a hundred thousand dollars and then just walking away never dealing with advertising again. He also didn't pay attention as competitors. He... I I do think I'm gonna white Bother because he just says a very unique approach to his work. That was a widely successful. So it's right why we can learn from them. But this thing is like, okay. Yeah. You don't what wanna do Ads? Pick me an ad, and then your wife goes down and she could buy any car she wants on me. Okay. So It said so now now Claude talking about the unusual persuasive ability of of Albert Las. So far as I know, no ordinary human being has ever resisted Albert Las. He has commanded what he would in this world. Presidents have made them their path presidents have made him their power. Nothing he desired has ever been forbidden him. What a crazy sentence. Let me read that again. Nothing he desired has ever been forbidden him. So I yielded. As all due to his persuasive. And so that starts his career. He's gonna wanna up working for Albert getting paid a ton of money. I think for 16 17 years or something like that, and then he he... He's gonna quit and go into business on his own and he and he'll talk about the last chapter. I think what the last chapter his book might be, like, his greatest mistakes. Actually, why don't I just tell you what it is by looking at it. You no, the next last chapter is my great mistake and and that's just waiting too long to do what he actually wanted to do. Alright. So let's go back to some some ideas that he derive from this point is career. The greatest 2 faults in advertising, lion boasts and ins selfish. That's another point to consider. Are you anything for your own advantage and people will resist will resist you to the limit, but seem un selfish to consider your customer's desires and they will naturally flock to you. The greatest 2 faults line advertising. The greatest 2 faults in in advertising line boasts in un consumption. So go back to that that. The article or the they'll add about book, hey. Send me money I'll send you your book. Or how about, hey, I'm sending you the book if you like to send me money. Same the same desire. The book the books bookstore has the same desire. 1 approach works in 1 doesn't. Because 1 is not just asking for things that just advantage you. It's very interesting. People will listen if you talk service to them, they will turn their backs and always when you seek to impress an advantage for yourself, this is important. So he also says that cuss... That companies do this as well. And he's is him implying that that principle to advertising tires. He gets a goodyear account. At the time, yeah, there they're spending... There was really no tire advertising to speak of. And this is way to pro... Apply that principle or, another way is how you can get 30000 customers in just a few months. Another problem we had to solve was to get dealers to carry tire stocks. Okay? So I'm goodyear you're hear the manufacturer. I have dealers that sell it to that and customer, but they're only buying for me as the customer needs it. But I want more money up upfront so. But I can't say, hey, why don't you guys buy more stock for me because then I'm just saying I'm appealing to my advantage. That's not helping you. I'm not serving you. So he flips it. This guy's of freaking genius. So it says, we wanted to solve a way to get dealers to carry tire stocks. A few of them did so in those days. They bought from Goodyear branches as they sold. We prepared a large newspaper campaign. We prepared a large paper campaign and offered to to name in each ad all the dealers who stock the minimum requirement are who all who stock. The minimum requirement was 250 dollar stock. So if you buy, if you will keep at your location 2 the minimum of 250 dollars worth of tires from us. As we advertise our tire, we will also advertise your name as where you can get the tire. Right? So it's... I want you to buy stock for me. You say that? No one's buying stock from you. If be saying, hey, if you buy stock for me, I will also advertise you in this national newspaper campaign I'm doing. They'll buy stock from you. The minimum requirements 2 dollars 2... I already read that. In a few months, we induce some 30000 dealers to stock goodyear tires on that basis, and the... And the campaign did much to change the whole complexion of the tire. Us. This naming of dealers in local advertising is an almost irresistible induce to stock. Few plans are more effective. No deal likes to see his rivals named in a big campaign and his own name omitted. The more who joined in the plan the easier it is to get others. I have often secured on new products almost universal distribution this way. More random advice from him talking about, you know, you really just stay inside your circle competence if you wanna think about it That terms, It is curious how we all desire to sell in something outside of our province. That leads many men astra. Men make money in 1 business and then lose it in many others. They seem to feel that once success makes them super businessmen as well. This... I don't know why when I read that part reminding me of the the quote for warren Buffett in last week's book. We're og mother, they're talking about, hey, we're gonna go It was very common this time, we're gonna go about even against Og b's wishes going on and acquiring other advertising agencies? And warren like, instead of buying other agencies, why don't you just buy the best agency and they're like, what? And he's like, your own? Buy more of your stock. If you're the best of advertising agency in the world, buy more of that. And the the lesson there's is a lot of these people went out and bought, other advertising wanna losing money on that. So going back to this this... His his desire free trials, est estate Lau the same way. Give free trials, but only to those who ask of it. Right? Don't just set send your product everybody diminishes the quality. I have never found that it paid to either to give either a sample or a full size package to people who did not request it. We must arise interest in our product before it has valued to anybody. I consider Prom sampling a very bad plan indeed. Products handed out without asking are thrown on the doorstep lose respect. It is different when you force people to make an effort. He's already mentioned a dozen variations of the same idea, So obviously he's telling us It's exceptionally important. You cannot go into a well occupied, a well occupied well occupied field on the simple appeal by my brand. That is a selfish appeal. It's rep pregnant to all. 1 must offer except... Exceptional service to induce people to change from favorite brands to yours. The usual advertiser does not offer that exceptional service. That's why He keeps talking over and over again in the book like, although the money wasted said advertising can pay the national debt. Oh, so he's... This is... Okay. Now Reached the part I was mentioning earlier about my note is personalities appeal, soul his corporations do not. He's doing them. He's re re ramping a brand of breakfast cereal. And so he he he establishes an actual, like, person. To act as a brand. So she says, I establish a personality. Professor a p Anderson. I've always done that whenever possible. Personalities appeal, Soul cook... While Soul Corporations do not make a man famous and you make his creation famous, and all of us love to study men in their accomplishments. This is more about him... Him it's essentially working remotely in a long time ago. He says I earned commissions as high as a hundred and 85000 dollars in a year. That's equivalent about 4000000 dollars in a year now. All earned at a type rider, which I operated myself without a clerk or secretary and much of it earned in the woods. That's where he's living. So think about that. I made 4 dollars a year working at home by myself at a type rider which I operated without a secretary and most of it in the woods and in Michigan. But he also spent a large amount of time teaching teaching teaching, serving serving serving. I was doing more than than just serving myself. I was doing my best to teach other copy men in the agency. I held many meetings with them to discuss the principles a copy. For that, I received no pay. Then I wrote numerous books to set down the print agency principles. Because of those services, mister last mister Las finally made me president of Lord and Thomas. So he didn't say make me president first, and then I'll do this. He's saying, I'm just gonna teach everybody around me. I'm gonna serve those, try to help them better at their job, and the the as a result of that service, I'll get what I deserve. So don't know know myself in this next section. I'm trying to read it before I read it to you. Oh, okay. I wrote... This is very good, read it twice. Alright. I'm not gonna have read it twice, but you'll know how I feel about How have I been able to win from this situation so many great successes? Simply because I made so many mistakes in a small way and learn something from each? I made no mistake twice. Every once in a while, I developed some great advertising principle. That endured. That method cost me beginning as I did in the infancy of advertising an enormous amount of time, more time than other men are apt to devote to this primitive experience, much more time, much more sacrifice. Then I would want a son of mine to the vote. That is the purpose of this auto to help other people 6... To to help other people start where I ended. Going back to this idea, treating ads treating customers, personalized them. Taking as like, an actual ad, Think It would add as a salesperson, like, make it in human form. Just like if somebody inquiring something like the the the lady that was interested about sewing machines. Like, she like, the way you responded to her mail is not the way you were to just respond to enter in person to apply scientific advertising. 1 was recognized that ads or salesman. 1 must compare them 1 by 1 on a salesman basis. And hold them responsible for cost and result to advertise blindly, teaches 1 nothing, and it usually leads to the rocks. Regardless of principles we must always experiment. And the no left myself is the world still has secrets to give up. We do not know everything about the the the complex world that we live in. That's why you experiment because you're gonna derive insights and knowledge that you can't otherwise, you can't just sit there and think them up in your minds. They're too unpredictable. The world still has secrets to give up. More in this idea of thinking about advertising as a service. Don't talk about yourself. Talk about what service your product will give the customer. So it says I've seen many at many ad killed by single unfortunate phrase. Usually a selfish phrase, indicating ul tier desires, which repel, phrases like insist on... What's that word? Oh, insist on this brand, avoid imitation. Look out for substitution. Such appeals have no good effect and they indicate a motive with which buyers cannot sympathize. Forget yourself entirely. Have in your mind a typical prospect, interested enough to read about your product. Keep that prospect before you. Seek in every word to increase your good impression, say only way you think a good salesman should say if that prospect stood stood before him. See, hey he said hitting the same idea in different context over and over again. Then if you could sell it in person, you can sell it in print. Do not boast, not about your plant or your output. Not about anything more interesting to you than to your prospect. Boasting is repulsive. Random, great. Quote here, most success comes through efficiency, most failures are due to waste. Oh, this is very interesting. The best school I know is canvas. So going Door to door. Right? The best goal I know is canvas. Going from home to home. Many great ad writers spend half their time in that. They learn by personal contacts, what wins and what were pulses. Then they apply their findings in appeals, then they find... Then they apply their findings to appeals in print. So people are like, no one's gonna do that nowadays. It hit me when I read this. Of the most successful apps, modern day apps did this. You go back and read that book. I think it's how to turn on a billion dollars something like that. Evan Sp speaking, the founder of Snapchat. The very early is. He would go out and hand flyers in person at the mall. And ask people to download snapchat. He was doing this by hand. At the very beginning. It sounds... It sounds like, fake. Right? Unreal. There's there's a there's this quote that Paul graham uses, which is Hilarious. It's because it the Call install. So the very being days of stripe, the Call brothers would be describing to other people, like other founders, what Stripe could do for their business. And then the people would never say, oh, wow, that that sounds like something interesting. Instead of sending an email with a link or saying hey, go to my website they're like, oh, sounds interesting like, give me your laptop. And they would literally install stripe on the laptop. They wouldn't let that prospect that that temporary interest be fleeting. Like, hey I'll do it for you. So again, like, this whole idea is like, you can drive insights in person. And you're not gonna do that later on, as your as your business is more stable at the very beginning, You know, you have to know why people are, like, what what your... What service you're trying to give to people and and how they feel about that. I know I that that was very, very interesting. Okay. So just more a few more things here. I wanna talk about his greatest mistake because that this interesting. And really, his greatest mistake was not taking a chance on himself. So nice was talking about something gonna happen or in his earlier life, mister Bi, president of the company called me to his office. He said, I also had advice to give you. You have many of the qualifications which make for success, including the selling instinct. You were too good a man to work for me You should start out for yourself as I did, Or you should start out for yourself as I did. He told me something of his history, Having had refused every salary offer every say safe and struggled alone. And how as a result he had finally arrived on the road to Fortune. He ended by saying I'm selfish enough to want you to stay here. If you do, your salary will be much increase next year, but I'm am fair enough to advise you not to stay. Don't let someone else glean the chief profits from your hard work and your talent. My Scottish conservatism led me to stay. It was my great mistake. Soon after that, I married and any venture of my own became increasingly difficult. Thus I tied myself to a lifetime of service as an employee. I watched some of my coworker start out, for themselves largely lines that I had taught them. I feel now as then as I did then, that I was that I was fully as well as equipped as they were safe for courage. So I was talented as them, but I wasn't as courageous to. I always envy their independence, which I spent 35 years to attain. So he finally does make the jump, he says, you know, it just took me... Not he didn't waste 35 years because he's learning too, but if he do it all over again, he would jumped. And part of it was his wife pushing them, you know, to have that desire. Because sure it's very comfortable I can stay at home. I can do what I'm really good at, and I'm still making a lot of money, but he he wants ownership. So it says an ambitious wife was the 1 who woke me from that let authority. She desires for which money counted more than fame, She pointed out how those who employed me always gain the advantage in a monetary way. Finally, I considered her viewpoint, and after many years of working for others, I started to work for myself. I've already made more by sharing the profits of my creations than I ever made by working on commission. 1 of my first ventures was in a toothpaste. I bought a share in that for which I paid 13000 dollars. It paid me some 200000 dollars in dividends, and then I sold a stock for 500000 dollars. So that's 700 grand. Right? Based on an an investment he'd made for a company he's doing advertising for, and this is 700000 dollar in 19 20 money. So now he's got some insights on money and happiness, which I always was find interesting. I long lived in other poverty were hunger and I were pals. When I entered business, I had to miss 2 meals a week to pay for my laundry bills. I also have lived in luxury, spending as high as a hundred and 40000 dollars a year. It has made little difference to me. I was as happy in 1 condition as the other. I do not think we can go back to humble conditions without being being in pain, but I'm sure the men can be as happy as 1 another, can be as happy on 1 plateau as another. The happiest man I know is a neighbor of mine who never made more than a hundred and 25 dollars per month. Out of that, he saved enough to build 6 small houses, which he rents, then he retired on that income. He spends his summer on the lake working working in his garden and and and his winters in Florida. I often go down to his cottage for a lesson in contentment. Until the income tax was established, I kept no record of my earnings. Their volume meant nothing to me. Their ups and downs did not affect me in the least. This is not... Excuse me, this is all recite to indicate that my incentive for work was not money. Nor was the fame or position. I care nothing for either out out here in the woods amongst simple people where Have built my home. All things are handicapped which in any way seemed to place me above my fellows. Here in the country, we all meet on a quality. I have worked for the fun of working, and because work became a habit with me. Then later in business because I realized that somebody had to do a deal of hard work to get advertising out of its swallowing close. So he's saying, like, I'm doing work for my clients and the firm, but I'm also trying to grow the industry as a whole. And this is where he's talks about what he gained from this. What have I gain this is just really really good writing. This idea that the principles are... The principal sees learning enduring is the Swiss alps. This is fantastic. What have I learned by... What have I gained by these many years of exceptional application? I have gained what others gained by medical research by spending their lives in the laboratory? My life work has been research and advertising. Now I have the privilege of setting down my findings for the men who follow me. I have the hope that the record will save to many of the mistakes of the pioneers and the years that I spent to correct them. I have gained what Thomas Edison had gained by his 20 hour days. The satisfaction knowing that Discovered some enduring principles. Many argue that advertising is changing that the times call for something new. Certainly the temple of life in America changing. Fad, fan and desires change. Certain styles and advertising are changing. It is and always has been necessary to give every campaign a different keynote. I imitate never succeed. But human nature does not change. The principal sit down in this book are as in are as enduring as the alps. And now we reached the part where I referenced earlier about. He's he got some interesting insights living where he grew up and I'll close on this. Many hard years went by before I saw this boy home again. Then the homing instinct brought me back. I bought a bluff of virgin forest, which I've always loved as a boy, and I named it Pine crust. There I built my home which for 17 years, I've enlarged and developed into a paradise. Here, I do what I love to do in beautiful surroundings. Here a mile apart are the contrast to show what I've gained by my efforts. Here remains some who never dared to show me what might have been. Here is my mother land. Here my tab. Hear my home. I'm sure that no man has gained more from life than I have. More of true happiness and content. I traced that to the love of simple things of common people, which made my success in advertising. Here at our weekend parties, I meet many successful men in the most intimate way. I envy none of them. The happiest are those who live closest to nature, an essential to advertising success. So I conclude that this vocation depending as it does on love and knowledge of the masses, offered many more rewards beyond money. And that is where I'll leave it.
