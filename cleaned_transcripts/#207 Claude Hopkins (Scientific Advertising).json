  "transcript": "Human nature is perpetual. In most respects, it is the same today as the time of caesar. So the principles of psychology are fixed and enduring. You will never need to un learn what you learn about them. We learn for instance that curiosity is 1 of the strongest human incentives. We employed it whenever we can. Puff wheat and puff rice were made successful largely through curiosity. For them, we used headlines like food shot from guns, a hundred and 25000000 steam explosions caused in every kernel. These few foods were failures before that factor was discovered. We learned that people judged largely by price. They're not experts. In the British National Gallery is a painting which is announced in the catalog to have cost 750000 dollars. Most people at first pass at a glance then later they learned what the painting cost. They return and surround it. A department store advertised a hundred dollar hat, and the floor could not hold the women who came to see it. We often employ this factor. Perhaps we are advertising a valuable formula. To merely say that would not be impressive. So we state as a fact that we paid a hundred thousand dollars for that formula. That statement when tried has won a wealth of respect. Many have advertised, try my product for a week. If you don't like it, will return your money. Then someone can conceived the idea of sending goods without any money down and saying, pay in a week if you like them. That proved many times as impressive. 1 great advertising man stated the difference this way. 2 man came to see me. Each offering me a horse. Both made equal claims. They were good horses. A child could drive them. 1 man said, try the horse for a week. If my claims are not true, come back for your money. The other man said, try the horse for a week, but then he added, come and pay me then. I naturally bought the second man's horse. An advertiser offered a set of books to businessman. The advertising was unprofitable, so he consulted another expert. The ads were impressive. The offer seemed attractive, but said the second man, let us add 1 little touch, which I found very effective. Let us offer to put the buyer's name in gold lettering on each book. That was done, and without another change in the ads, they sold some hundreds of thousands of books. Do some peculiar kin in human psychology, the names in gold gave much added value to the books. In the same way, it is found that an offer limited to a certain class of people is far more effective than a general offer. For instance, an offer limited to veterans of the war, are to members of a lodge are to executives. Those who are entitled to any seeming advantage will go a long way not to lose that advantage. An advertiser suffered much from substitution. He said, look out for substitutes. Be sure you buy this brand, etcetera with no effect. These were selfish appeals. Then he said, try our rivals too. In his headlines. He invited comparisons and showed that he did not fear them. That corrected the situation. Buyers were careful to get the brand so cons superior that its maker could court a trial of the rest. There is a great deal in mental impression. Submit 5 products exactly alike, and 5 people may choose 1 of them, but point out in 1, some qualities to notice and everyone will find them. The 5 people then will all choose the same product. These are just some examples. There are endless phases to psychology. Some people know them by instinct. Many of them are taught by experience, but we learn most of them from others. When we see a winning method, we noted down for use when the occasion offers. These things are very important. An identical offer made in a different way may bring multiplied returns. That was an excerpt from the chapter on psychology of the book scientific advertising written by Claude Hopkins. So I wanted to cover this book because it I thought it was it would be a good bonus episode to go with the the the book, the the biography on Albert Alaska that I just did because Claude and Albert work together for, I think like 17 years. Claude hopkins will sound familiar to to may sound familiar to because back on founders number 1 70. I read his biography. My life in advertising. He is largely regarded as probably the the greatest copywriter. To ever live. And so I wanna pull out this quote from David Og in his book over and advertising. And he says nobody should be allowed to have anything to do with advertising until he has read this book 7 times. It has changed the course of my life. That is very high praise for a very short and very old book. So this book is a hundred pages maybe, and that's being very generous because the the the chapters go by really fast. It was first written, the story goes that it was first written. Albert Oscar thought it was too valuable that he locked it away in his vault for 20 years. It was then released and quickly sold, a lot of copies. Since it's been released, I think it was released in the 19 twenties, 19 23, if I'm mistaken, it sold over 8000000 copies. So let's jump right into the beginning of the book. Claude is talking about what is... Like, what is this book kinda to come about. And every principle that he talks about in the book. And the the few... References he just gave us in the the in the chapter about the the unique weird result from human psychology just how you torque 1 little thing and the results can be vastly different. It this... None of this is theory. It comes from... You're you're reading the words of a practitioner. Or somebody that sent spent 12 hours a days, 7 days a week for decades. Learning the art of copywriting of advertising of sales. And so he says, some of these agencies and their are hundreds of campaigns have tested and compared thousands of plans and ideas. All that he learned he learned from trial error. The results have been watched and recorded, so no lessons have been lost. Individuals may come and go, but they leave their records and ideas behind them. These become a guide to all who follow. That's a very simple sentence, but a very profound idea. If you think about it if you pick up this book. Right? And you're reading this book. You're having a 1 sided conversation with a master of his craft that's been dead almost a hundred years. So individuals may come and go, but they leave their records and ideas behind them. I'm holding the the record of his ideas of his career in my hand. These become a guy to all who follow. Nearly, every selling question which arises in business is accurately answered by many experiences. In the way I interpret that sentence is what you're going do is not unique. People in the past have gone through the same situations. They've run countless different experiences and most of those lessons are put down in a book. I'm para Mark and Jason and why he reads so many biographies. You know, there's there's throughout history, thousands of years. Been really smart people. They ran all these experiments. They've learned all these things. Somebody put them down in a book we should probably pick up those books and read them. Right? The compass of accurate knowledge directs the shortest, safest, cheapest course to any destination. Giving you the why you'd would wanna read it. We learn the principles and prove them by repeated tests. We compare 1 way with many others. Backward and forward and record the results. That's why this book is called scientific advertising. It's all about trial and error. I have an hypothesis. I test my assumption, and I record the records. It was that assumption accurate. No. Okay. Let me do another Was it accurate? Yes? Okay. Let's double down on that. When 1 method invariably proves the best, that method becomes a fixed principle. To reduce the cost of results, even 1 percent means much. So no guess work is permitted. 1 must know what is best. And you get to the main point like, why so many entrepreneurs and people building products, advertising services like, why is this important to? Because our final conclusions are always based on cost per customer. So that's an important concept in Hopkins day. It's just as important today. Right... When you hear this concept that he's describing, most often, you'll hear it as C, customer acquisition cost, and the idea behind it is very simple, like, you be constantly running experiments on how how much does it cost you to get each customer. And the the as you continue to run these experiments, that cost should go lower and lower, the lower goes, the more profitable we become. So that's why so many people read books read this book and and use Hopkins principles because they're they're the foundation on which you can build an extremely profitable business. And in some cases he not only make himself wealthy through these principles, but he made countless other clients unbelievably wealthy to these principles. They become fundamentals for advertising in general. They are universally applies. Applied. No wise advertiser will ever depart from these varying laws. It's very similar to what Og just said. It's like, you no 1 should have any... No 1 you get close to advertising unless they've read this book 7 times. We propose in this book to deal with those fundamental. Those universal principles to teach only established techniques. The lack of those fundamentals has been the main trouble with advertising of the past. Each worker was a law to himself or what they're saying there. Or what Claude is saying there It's like, the... The... Everybody was running these experiments, but no 1 was actually comparing the effectiveness. We're collecting a this information and turning into a scientific process as opposed to just this throwing darts against the wall. All previous knowledge, all progress in the line was a closed book to him. So he's saying the advertising man at at at some point might be running these experiments, he might be doing failures and and when he could expedite and improve the effectiveness to work if he would just learn from the experience the past experience Right? It was, like a man and this is a perfect like, metaphor for that. It was, like, a man trying to build a modern train without first ascertain entertaining what others had done. And then he he talks about the importance of testing your assumptions. Right? No 1 knows if your product is it when succeed or not. This section reminded me a a couple weeks ago maybe a couple of months ago. I read Sid myers auto. And he was talking about, like you know, I was making these... He's a computer program or 1 of the first, like, made 1 of the first, like, computer programmers I made games. And he talks about, like, you know I was building all these flight simulators, like, they were selling, but I really wanted to make this comprehensive gigantic, like, a giant strategy game about the history of human civilization. And conventional wisdom at the time Was like, no, Don't do that. It. Like, just... No one's gonna buy a strategy game. What are you talking about? Just stick to your your flight simulators. Right? Because they're making money, and he went with... His instinct he's like well, let me just build it. Let me see what happens. So we test, you know, my assumption I like this game maybe other people who like it. That went up selling over 51000000 copies. Ones being his life's work. And so this this paragraph reminded me when I read it of what I learned from Sid meyer. It is hard to measure human... The preferences and prejudices, the likes and dislikes that exist. We cannot say that a product will be popular, but we know how to sell it in the most effective way. The blind leading the blind is ridiculous. It is pitiful in a field with such fast possibilities. And so that little dig at the end, blind leading in a blind he he's compare... Throughout the book comparison contrast. This is the way I go down minecraft. This is the results I've gotten and these are the people that it's... That proposed. They think we're in the same industry. They think we're in the same genre, but we're really not because they don't know what we're... What they're actually doing. And so there's a lot of that, like, he's saying listen, advertising is a admirable field. It can grow larger if we can show results, stop just guessing, stop doing advertising just for the sake of advertising, actually prove to your customers that it's effective. Now he gets into the main point, what we talked about in albert alaska. We talked about David O overview. What is advertising? Advertising is salesman ship. In there in their days of a self salesman ship in print. It is a way to derive leverage for your business So you don't have to employ thousands of individual salespeople, so to know that myself is advertising is salesman leveraged. To probably understand advertising or to learn even its ru. 1 must start with the right consumption. Advertising a salesman. It's principles are the principles of salesman. Therefore, every advertising question should be answered by the salesman standards. Let us emphasize that point. The only part purpose of advertising is to make sales. It is profitable or unprofitable according to its actual sales. Treat it as a salesman, force it to justify itself. Figure its cost and result, accept no excuses, then you will not go wrong. The difference is only in degree. Advertising is multiplied salesman. It may appeal to thousands, while the salesman talks to 1. And so that's another illustration of the point that I made in the the Las, podcast where he wrote a bunch of different ways. He found ways that to leverage it to exploit leverage. 1 of them is the fact that he only dealt with a handful of clients. He built strong relationships with them. He wind up, having access to extremely large, advertising budgets, but he gets a percentage of that. And he was able to increase the advertising budget because he was the first person to realize, hey, instead just being a broker, why don't we actually do the creative aspect, show that our copy our combine the our copywriting with the leverage that advertising and newspaper and magazines gives us, this will increase the amount of sales that our customers get as they increase the amount of sales though increase the advertising budget and will make more. And so in a sense, you could think of Albert Las is just str str these 2 points of leverage. And using them to build an enormous personal fortune. A salesman mistake may cost little. An advertisers mistake may cost thousands times that much. Be cautious. A mediocre or salesman may affect a small part of your trade. Mediocre mediocre advertising affects all of your trade. So there's a bunch going on this page, do a small test before spending a large amount. Selling in person is valuable experience. So a lot of the the the the insights that door door salesman would learn, claude, apply that to, to advertising and print. Ob also did this. He so he sold door to door, a bunch of like, stove, like, some kind of oven, and then use those insights for... When he was building his own advertising firm. I'm still reading my note to you. Right as if the per... If the person was in front of you. The more you tell the more you sell. Okay. So let's see what's going on here. Many of the able men in advertising are graduate salesman. The best we know have been house to house salespeople. They may know little of grammar, nothing of rhetoric, but they know how to use words that convince a fair answer to those questions avoids countless mistakes. But when 1 tries to show off, so their whole point is like, there's a lot of people in the industry that are trying to win awards are trying to entertain. He's like, no. We're all we're all about sales. And so a lot of these insights that were applying, like, when you... When... The person was going door to door trying to sell something, a vacuum cleaner or stove, a bunch of knives, whatever they were selling at the point. They weren't trying to entertain you. Like, it wouldn't have worked. Like, their their time is limited, they have to convince you to hand over some money or they can't keep doing that. So Claude point here is, like, listen, think about treated as if that person's that prospect is span it sent standing in front of you. And so if you think about it like that, like, before I write this word or the sentence of paragraph, would it help a salesman sell the goods? Would it help me sell them if I met a buyer person? And so his point is, if you answer those questions, the correct if you're able to answer those correct questions correctly, it avoids countless mistakes. And so stick to that. And he says when 1 tries to show off or does things merely to please, he is he's little likely to strike a chord, which leads people to spend money. Then you continue to. Some people say, be very brief. People will read for little. Would you say that to a salesman? So this whole thing is just treat your ad as if you're on an individual basis basis. Right? Would you say that to a salesman? With a prospect standing before him, would you find him to any certain number of words. That would be an unthinkable handicap, so don't do it in your ads. So in advertising, the only readers we get are whom, are people whom are subject interest? No 1 reads ads for amusement long or short, consider them as prospects standing before you, seeking information, give them enough information to get action. So with countless questions, measure them by salesman standards. Not by amusement standards. And this is something he repeats over and over again. This is 1 of the greatest advertising faults. Ad writers abandon their parts. They forget their salesman and try to be performers. Instead of sales they seek applause. And so he goes back to this idea. Like, everything we do is based on an individual level. Right? This is something that Steve Drops said. I was like, well, how are you, you know, Apple in the 70... Late seventies early eighties It's like, you you're just a, you know, you you sell to consumers. How are you going to expand your market sell to businesses. And jobs is just, like, corporations are just collections of individuals. So just treat them as individuals. He applied that to the market for his computers. Hopkins is applying that to add to advertising. Don't think of people in the mass that gives you a blurred view. Think of a typical individual who is likely to want what you sell. Then he talks about the importance of research. The advertising man studies the consumer. He tries to place himself in the position of the buyer. His success largely depends on doing that to the exclusion of everything else. And then this is also something we've mentioned multiple times, not only in the last podcast, but also the podcast, with the Ob b podcast as well. This idea where... You'll see these ads forever. They they're written from the point of the perspective of a company. And people are self interested. They're not. They don't care what you're... What you made. They wanna know how it affects them. And so it says some ads are planned and written with a totally wrong conception. These... They are written to please the seller. The interest of the buyer are forgotten. 1 can never sell goods profit in person are in print when that attitude exists. And so Claude solution to this is you should be offering service. You should be telling... If you want somebody to give you money, you have to start with what am I what am I what service am Offering you? What am I doing for you for you to give me your money? Not just, hey, buy my brand. No 1 cares about you. Right? No 1 cares about the company of their product. They're... They have their own problems. Remember the people you address are selfish as we all are. They care nothing about your interests are your profit. They seek service for themselves. This is why henry report has a famous quote that money comes naturally as a result of service. First, you find a way to serve people, and then the second part is you find a way to increase the number of people you serve. Ignoring that fact is a is a common mistake and cost mistake in advertising. Ad say in effect buy my brand. Give me the trade that you give to others. Let me have the money. This is not a popular appeal. The best ads ads ask no 1 to buy. That is useless. The ads are based entirely on service. Though good at etsy means. They offer wanted information. They cite advantages to users. Some of these ads... May seem alter altruistic, but they are based on the knowledge of human nature. The writers know how people are led to buy. Here again is salesman ship. The good salesman does not merely cry a name. He doesn't say buy my product. A brush maker, so he he's giving an example of somebody going door to door trying to sell brushes. Okay? And this is all ties to, like, this like, to to to human psychology that you present similar things in a slightly different way and you get varying different results. A brush has 2000 door to door salespeople people. He's enormous successful. In in in an industry, which would seem very difficult. Okay. So how did he do it? And it would be if his man asked their asked the house wives to buy. So they're knock on the door, hey buy my brush, But they don't. They go to the door and say, I was sent here to give you a brush. I have samples here and I want you to take 1 of your choice. Okay. So they're giving away... You're saying, hey, I'm... I have a brush been sent here, pick the 1 you want. The housewife is all smiles and attention in picking the 1 brush She sees several that she wants. She's is anxious to reciprocate the gift, so the salesman gets an order. I think is the rest reciprocity principle, Mom talks about this, It's well known in phenomenon and psychology. There's a famous book that a lot of entrepreneurs read. It's a the psychology of influences of influence by Robert K, I think is his name. But essentially, the the phenomenon is playing out in this example. It's not, hey, knocking the door buying a brush. They're gonna slam in the door, maybe get, you know, 10 percent of the customers you would. Otherwise, But saying, hey, I have a brush. No no obligation. Pick the 1 you want. She picks the brush, then she's like, wait. Like, it's the natural instinct for humans. Like, once we... Somebody does favor to reciprocate that favor. And that's why this phenomenon also you see and I think, I I don't know if it was if it was in K book that I learned this. Forgot where I heard this. But the... You see this in people asking for donations. Like, the people to airport, you'd see them, or they used to be. They're in, like, they're, like, monks they're and robes. It's, like, Harry Krishna or something like that. What these people would do and it went working marvelous. Somebody did, like an in endeavor research and how much money. They were make making hundreds of millions of dollars a year doing this. They would, like, hand somebody, like, a flower or something like that. Like, or, like, a rose petals. Whatever it was. I can't remember exactly it was they'd handed you first then ask for a donation, and it, you know, like, doubles or triples the effectiveness. Somebody that was doing this research winds up finding out... Like, they went up tracking what they were doing. So a person would be handed a flower. Right? Maybe they gave them a buck or 2 or whatever it was, then they'd walk around the corner and they throw the flower in the trash. The the guy or the person doing the the the the analysis of the sales method. Realized that the Harry Kushner had its down so much that they knew that likely after they gave the gift. They'd throw it away. So they would recycle the flowers by going through the trash and picking them back up and reusing them. So again, this is just something, like, a fundamental kin of human psychologist used over and over again, that works all the time. So that's why you see so many brands giving free samples free trials free demonstrations first before asking for money. And so he'll gives us different examples of different products using the same principle. The maker of an electric sewing machine found advertising difficult, and he found advertising difficult because he's saying, hey, buy my machine doesn't work. So on good advice he cease solicit a purchase. He offered to send to any home, a a sewing machine for 1 week's use free of charge. No obligation Okay? With it would come a man to show how to operate it. Let us help you for a week without cost our obligations said the ad. Such an offer was resist and about 9 in 10 of the trials led to sales. So think about what do he saying. Because he's like, the same exact from the product makers perspective. It's the same... You're you're going have the same thing. I want to sell more of my product. Right? I try I... I try option 1. Throw an ad, look at this is a product, liquid does buy my product. Right? And then that limits... You know, you're not getting a lot of sales. Option 2. Hey, I have such faith in my products. Let me serve you for a week without cost or obligation, and I wanna up closing 90 percent of of the people that respond. This is why I said in in in the previous podcast. Like, the stuff to me is just like, indistinguishable for magic. So it says these are all common principles of salesman relationship. The most ignorant competitor applies them. Yet the salesman in print very often forgets them. He talks about his interest. So again, Hopkins is gonna repeat, he's got a few main principles here, and he's gonna repeat the same stuff over over again, So gets to our fixed skulls. People are self interested. Don't forget this is what he's telling us. People do whatever they do to please themselves. Many fewer mistakes would be made in advertising if these facts were never forgotten. And now we see, like, why books like this would sell 8000000 copies because when you study what works, you realize there's huge variance in results, and it's a difference between going bankrupt and go and becoming wealthy. A man who was selling a 5 dollar product. The replies for he... Does a direct, like, a mail order product. The replies from his ad cost him 85 cents. Another man submitted an ad, which he thought was better. The replies went started to cost 14 dollars and 20 cents. So if I sell something for 5 bucks, and each cost of sale cost makes me only cost 85 cents, I can get wealthy if there's enough people that want that product. Right? But if I'm selling 5 bucks and it cost 14 dollars get kind. I'm I'm out of the game real fast. Another man submitted an ad, which for 2 years brought replies of an average of 41 cents each. So that's his also point where The main point is, hey, there's ads at work do not stop pulling them. Right? Before they work. Or before they the the the effectiveness diminishes, And sometimes you can ads can run for a decade, 2 decades. And the way to think about that is the the app for Og. Where he's like, listen, you're not advertising to standing army. You're advertising to a moving parade. Now, but that doesn't mean when you find a new, an ad that works that you stop experimenting and trying to improve the effectiveness of your advertising, which is what Hopkins is telling us right here. Listen, this dude this guy was making... He's making good money because he... His ads... He's getting a customer for 85 cents and he's selling for 5 bucks. But then they did another test, and realized, hey. Now each ad... Excuse me each customer is costing me half that much. Now it's not 85 cents. It's 41 cents, and this is where Hopkins ties it all together for us. And consider the difference on 2... On a quarter million replies per year in this guy's business. Only saving half the cost on 250000 replies a year. And he's gonna talk to us about the this huge variance and results. Some people were paying paying for sales from 2 to 35 times what they needed to cost before the hoc conservative writing ads for them. Right? They were paying 2 to 30... So my ad, his... What he he's saying is, like, my writing was they were paying, the people that they hired previously, were charging them double to 35 times more than the effectiveness of my advertising. And what if they were making a profit at 35. Right? And now he found a way to to reduce their cost by 35 times. It's insane. A study of mail order advertising reveals many things worth learning. If continued, you know that it pays, study those ads with a respect. It is proven advertising, not theoretical. It will not deceive you The lessons it teaches are principles which wise men apply to all advertising. And so now he goes back to this idea where everybody tells you has to be short at. He's like, no. We our our testing reveals the opposite. Mail order advertising tells a complete story if the purpose is to make an immediate sale. You see no limitations there on the amount of copy. The motto here is the more you tell, the more you sell. And it has never failed to be proven wrong in any test we know. And at this point in his career, he's done thousands. Maybe tens of thousands of tests. So he goes back to this idea. You should be studying successful advertise. Alright ads. Look at the ad for a... For the mead cycle company. So they're selling bicycles. These these ads have been running for many years. The ads don't change. Mister Mead told the writer, meaning him, Hopkins is a funny. He always he always referencing the writer. It's like, is the way they say himself. Mister Mead told me, that not for 10000 dollars would he change a single word for for in his ads. For many years, he compared 1 ad with the other, and the ads you see today are the final results of those experiments. You may not like them. You may say they're unattractive, crowded are hard to read. Anything you will, but the test of the but the test of results has proved that those ads are the best salesman those lines have yet discovered and they pay. And so that's another way to for him to just pound into this eric expo on this point that he makes over to. Like, you've gotta test your assumptions. You cannot assume that you are correct. Just prove it. And he's, like, the the way to test assumption is not around a table, and in in an office in a meeting. He'll they just run a test and then do it again. So says, now he's now he's not talking about the importance of headlines. And we're already over a third away through about a third away through the bulk. It's written very quickly. Like, he does not... There's no, like, fluff in his book whatsoever. So it says, the the importance of headlines. Like, if you can't get somebody's attention. The headline is the vehicle to get somebody's attention. Right? And you can't sell somebody that's just not paying attention to you. And so if you have a problem, the the problem he's trying to solve is listen, ads can be ignored and the right headline is what solves this problem. People do not read ads for amusement. They don't read ads which at a glance seem to offer nothing interesting to them. Always bear that fact in mind. People are hu. The average person worth cultivating has too much to read. They skip 3 fourth of the paper, which they are paying to get newspapers. They are not going to read your business your business talk unless you make it worth their while and let the headline show it's don't bury the lead. Right? And so he's gonna tell, like, the headline is the most important part. They've write the writer of this chapter, meaning me again, spends far more time on headlines than on writing the ad. He often spends hours on a single headline. Often scores of headlines are discarded before the right 1 is selected. The identical ad run with various headlines differs tremendously it in its returns. It is not uncommon for a change in headlines to to multiply returns by 5 or 10 times over. So he gets a more specifics and 1 of his specifics is be specific. He's like, don't talk about... Don't avoid pla don't use general generations. They're so commonly used. Like, they have no meaning. Pick a freaking number. Don't don't say, I mean the best in the world. Everybody knows this and... That's not true. Pla twos and general and general rallies. Roll off to human understanding like water from a dock. They leave no impression whatsoever. To say best in the world, lowest price and existence, etcetera, is at best simply claiming the expected, And it also can lead people to not believe you. They lead readers to discount all the statements that you make. A man inclined to super pro must expect that his every statement will be taken with some caution. But a man who makes a specific claim is either telling the truth or not. A definitive claim is usually accepted. Actual figures are not generally discounted. Specific facts when stated have their full weight and effect. The weight of an argument may often be multiplied by making its specific. That's the most important sentence in the chapter. The weight of an argument may often be multiplied by making it specific. A dealer may say our prices have been reduced without creating any impression at all. But when he says our prices have introduced 25 percent, he gets the full value of his announcement. A male order advertisers sold women's clothing. For years, he used the slogan lowest price in America. His rivals all copied that. These claims became so common to every advertiser that they became commonplace and that thus 4, not effective. Right? Then under able advice, he changed the statement to our net profit is 3 percent. So we're saying well lowest prices of America doesn't work. Our net profit is 3 percent a specific example. That was a definitive statement and proved very impressive. No 1 could be expected to do business on less than 3 percent. The next year, the business made a sensational increase. So he's talking about there's a lot of these industries where everybody's advertising, the the the the the the competition is brutal. And so you've gotta use specific, 1 way to stand out is using specific claims. So he's talking about shaving soaps. Right? Shaving soaps have long been advertised. Abundant lat does not dry on the face. Acts quickly. So... Okay. But everybody uses those claims, so they're they... They're not effective. So a new a new entry comes into the field. It says a new maker came into the. He said, multiplies itself and lat 250 times. Soften your beard in 1 minute maintains its creamy fullness for 10 minutes on your face. And his advertising was wildly successful. So these are all specific claims and a sea of same. Right? He's gonna give us a bunch of examples. Makers of safety. Razors us of long advertised quick shaves. And then 1 maker advertised a 78 second shave. He gets the business. Use the world over as a very elastic claim. Lot of products say that. Then 1 advertiser said, my product is used by people's of 52 nations. He gets the business, and so he wraps up this chapter here. The difference is vast if a claim is worth making make it in the most impressive way. So now he's gonna talk about... He says, the headline of the chapters tell your full story. And this is about the more you sell the more you tell. Doesn't mean you go on and just make it 10000 words if you can tell the full story in 2. The point is, like, you're not gonna get their attention many times. So tell your full story, and if you can do that in 2000 words doing in 2000 words. If you could do it 500 doing 500. But don't, like, oh, I have 280 characters, and then I'm Like, no. That's not... You're you're you're wasting your advertising money. When once you get a person's attention, then is the time to accomplish all you ever hope to do with him. Bring all your good arguments to bear, cover every phase of your subject, 1 fact appeals to some 1 to another, omit anyone and a certain percentage will lose the fact which might convince. People are not app apt to read successive advertisements. No more than you read a news item twice or a story twice. In 1 reading under an advertisement 1 decides 4 or against the proposition. So present the reader when you... Once you get them every important claim you have. This is why he... He reduces everything he's saying here So the more you sell them more you tell. The best advertisers do that Gradually, they accumulate a list of claims important enough to use and all those claims appear in every ad thereafter. Some advertisers go so far is to never change their ads. This is what I just referenced earlier. Some mail mailer order ads have been running year after year without diminishing a return... Diminishing returns. I think the example Og uses in his books is, like, you know, it's very common. Like, when people get married, they they get a house And so maybe your your your client, you're selling washing machines. Right? And you're you realize that newlyweds are a large aspect of that market. Well, guess what? People get married this year, They're gonna get married next year, and they're gonna married 10 years from now those people where probably we want washing machines too. So don't change the ad. Is the the specific example I'm pretty sure he used in his book. The customer returns come from getting new readers. In every ad consider only new customers. People using your product are not reading your ads. They've already read and have decided. Any reader of your ad is interested. Else he would not he she would not be a reader. You are dealing with someone willing to listen, so do your level best. That reader if you lose them now, may never again be a reader. Okay. So now this is really interesting. The way to think about what he's explaining to us here is sell pain killers, not vitamins. And the... This principle applies, these are notes I'm for to myself by This principle applies to which benefit you choose to highlight and how to make the market for the same product bigger. Costly mistakes are me are being are made by blindly following some ill conceived idea. A product for instant, instance may prevent a disease. Prevention is not a popular subject, however much it should be. It's admirable, but people do not respond to it is what he's telling us. People will do much to cure trouble, but people in general will do little to prevent it. This has been proved by many disappointment, cell pain colors not vitamins. And he talks about using this contact in what you choose to show to a toothpaste may prevent may tend to prevent decay. It may also beautify teeth. Tests will show that the latter appeal, meaning I have a... If you use my product, you'll have beautiful teeth. Right? Is waste as many times as strong as the former, meaning that it's preventing decay. The most successful toothpaste advertiser never features tooth troubles in his headlines. They show the desired effect, beautiful, bright, sparkling white teeth. A soap may tend to cure eczema. It may at the same time improve complexion, So this is what I mean about you have to be very careful about choosing the benefit that you're promising to your customer because you may be artificially limiting the the amount of customers you can get. So you may have prevented or should be may have invented a cure for X eczema, but it's also so as a byproduct that improves your complexion do not advertise it as a cure for eczema. The eczema claim may appeal to 1 in a hundred while the beauty claims would appeal to nearly all. To even mention the eczema claims may might destroy the beauty claims. Then he goes into what it takes to get really good at what what he's doing. And he's like, listen, you gotta put in. Most people are not willing to put in the work, there's no substitute for the hard work and the time and the effort. You're gonna have to read and say he talks about, like, before you can ever advertise a product, you get it It's really studying and and and understand it sometimes this process can take weeks. Sometimes it could take months. Let me use an example of Og. He had he he got the Rolls royce account. And I think it was, like, 3 weeks of reading thousands of pages, and he came across this this random line. In I think it was like an engineering handbook for Rolls Royce. Like an internal handbook. And it said at 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in the news Rolls Royce comes from the electric clock that he used that as a as his headline. And it came from research. So this is what Hawkins is saying the same thing. An ad writer to have any chance of success must gain full information on a subject. The library of an ad agency should have books on every product that calls for research. A painstaking advertising man will often read for weeks on some problem, which comes up. Perhaps in many volumes he will find few facts to use. But some... But in some, 1 fact, may be the keynote of success, which is Rolls royce, over the example. Right? Jean... Now this is this is crazy because I feel like I've been quoting is he Sharp up a lot since I learned about what he said. And so this is Hopkins. Genius is the art of taking pains. The advertising man who spares the midnight oil will never get very far. Easy. Is he sharp as he's building 4 seasons. Right? 1 of the premier luxury brands the world's ever seen, he said excellence is often the capacity of taking pains. So that's what I said. What Claude shed said, genius is the art of taking pains. And he wraps up saying this is not for the lazy. The uninformed would be staggered to know the amount of work involved in a single ad. Weeks of work sometimes. The ad seems so simple and it must be simple to appeal to simple people, but behind that ad may lie re of data, volumes of information and months of research. This is no lazy man's field. Skipping ahead. He also got a way where he could just... We talked about this this idea. You gotta... Business just collections of people. You start with the individual, and he just has a way to just express ideas and, you know, 1 or 2 sentences. We must consider individuals. We cannot go after thousands of men until we learn how to win 1. This is the idea that a demo, a sample. It's just the best sales techniques that's ever been invented. There's not... There's nothing better way to sell your product. He used the example of the the guy with the horse or the the electric type writer or whatever that machine was sewing machine rather. And so this is an entire chapters. Like, you got use samples. It's just... It it do you it multiplies the effectiveness of your ads. It pays for itself many times over people and do this because Like, I'm gonna away my product or, you know, how do I afford to pay for? Is, like, you afford to pay for in in the the sales that that, happen in the future as a result of them using your product. The product itself should be its own best sales not the product alone, but the product plus a mental impression in atmosphere, which you place around it. Samples are of prime importance. However, expensive, they usually form the cheapest selling method. Samples serve numerous valuable purpose They enable 1 to use the word free in your ads. That and why is that important because if you can use word free that multiplies readers. The samples pay for themselves in multiplying the readers of your ads. So point is if you have 2 identical products are too identical ads the same product. 1 headline talks about. You get something free. The other headline doesn't. Way more people are gonna read the 1 says free. And so therefore, the demo pays for itself because it increases the effectiveness how many people she read the ad, The more people read it and more people buy. But his point is you don't give just rent... Like, you don't just mass mail samples of your your product to just random people. They have to ask for it. And he's like, you you're cheap it if you just... If it just shows up on the door without any kind of like, introduction to the client. And so you should introduce your product in a favorable favorable way using the demo as, like, almost like, a leverage salesperson. Right? So you introduce your product in a favorite way, and you do that through storytelling. And the story obviously comes from your ad. He says the product is cheap if it is not introduced in a favorable way. Many advertisers do not understand this. They supply thousands of samples to dealers to be handed out as they will. You should give samples to interested people only. They should ask for it. Right? Give them only to people who exhibit that interest by some effort, give them only to people whom you have told your story. Now he goes into importance of testing towards the end of the book already. This is it just goes by really, really quick. Like, this book you can read. Definitely in a day, you know, maybe definitely over weekend easily, depending on how many notes how much notes and, time you have. But this is just summarize, the world is full of surprises, and always has been and always will be, there are many surprises in advertising. A project you will laugh at may make a great success. A project you were sure of may fall down, all because tastes differ so much. None of us know enough people's desires to get an average viewpoint. So the solution is to test, and you the test sometimes screws, hey, I saves you money because I I was gonna be successful when I'm not. And in other cases, you get a surprisingly massive response that you didn't expect. We let the out... And he talks about, like, cap your downside. Right? Don't just do don't don't have an idea, and then like, I'm putting my entire advertising budget on this idea. Cap your downside, and then test. He repeats this because many spend a lot without testing first and they go broke. So he's saying instead of going... Before I go nationwide. I'll test my ad maybe in a a few different markets, and I'll cap it at a couple thousand dollars. So if that doesn't work out. Usually, I get most of the money back if not all the money back. But if it doesn't work out. I say, you, I spend a thousand instead of a couple millions and then putting the company Jeopardy, We let the thousands decide what the millions will do. We make a small venture and watch the cost and the result. When we learn what a thousand customers cost, we know almost exactly what a million will cost. When we learn what they buy, we know what when we know what the thousands buy, we will know what the millions will buy. From the few thousands we learn what the millions will do. So he talks about the people testing, he is playing on the safe side of a hundred to 1 shot. If the product is successful it may... It may make him millions. If he's mistaken about it, the loss is tri. So it's I kinda just ran over my own point there or Claude point there rather. These are facts we desire to emphasize and spread. So he's, like, stop doing... I've seen a bunch of people do a bunch of dumb shit, don't do... Don't repeat their mistakes. These people go out of business. There's no reason for that is what it was what he's telling us. All of our largest accounts are now built in this way from very small beginnings. Reiterate this point even if you have a great campaign that you you never stop testing ever. Costs can always go lower. So you gotta keep running these tests. We try test campaigns to... We do test campaigns to try out new methods of on already successful advertising. Thus we constantly seek better methods without interrupting already proven plans. If in 5 years for 1 food advertiser we tried over 50 separate tests, every little while we found an improvement. So the result of our advertising constantly grew. At the end of 5 years, we found the best plan of all. It reduced our cost of selling by 75 percent. So you already had an effective ad campaign. Now you found something that you weren't expecting and you did through testing. Du trial error is now reduced your cost by 75 percent. Congratulations. You're wealthy. That is, it was 4 times more effective than the best plan used before. Try out plan after plan after plan to constantly reduce the cost. So then he's talking here, you should be advertising the result. They don't... People do not buy products they buy solutions. Show health, not sickness. Don't show the wrinkles you propose to remove, but the face as it will appear. Your customers know all about wrinkles. Show pretty teeth, not bad teeth. Talk of gum coming good conditions, not conditions that exist. We are all attracted by sunshine, beauty, happiness health and success, point the way to them, not the way out of the opposite. Advertise result is a way to think about what he's telling us here. He's gonna give another example of how you stand out. So you got a bunch of people all trying to go up to same customers with similar products. You can differentiate just the way you up by proposing your solution. And this is... The the sales technique of the century. This is what Est Lau, Lau. Built her massive business empire out of last time I looked, you know, she's been dead for quite a while. She started that business in in her forties. I think it's somewhere the the founders 01:30 somewhere in there where I did her auto... Read her auto. She's completely slept on as a overlooked as an entrepreneur. If you could rein coordinate her today, bring her back, she'd be kicking almost every other entrepreneurs ass. She was extremely extremely gifted. Last time I looked Her the company was doing something, like, 18000000000 dollars in revenue, some something someone ridiculous number like that. Right? But she talked about 1 of the keys her success is the gift with purchase, which she referenced... The reason I referenced this. It's in inter auto, which is extremely easy to read by the way, in full useful information. She says that was a sales technique of the century. It's what the cornerstone she built her her empire off. She did not give away free samples. You bought something, and then she gave an extra gift and that caused you coming back and back and endured this goodwill that she cultivated over the entire lifetime of that customer. So this is a a way to stand out where we see somebody using that idea a couple decades before she did. Right? A male order advertiser offered a catalog. The inquire might send out for 3 or 4 similar catalogs. Okay? So it's... I have a catalog, but there's 3 or 4 of other companies that have catalog too. He had that competition. He... So he had competition making a sale. So he wrote a letter when he sent his catalog and enclosed a personal card. So you have not purchased anything yet. Right? You've inquired you say you want my catalog. I'm gonna send you the catalog just like my 3 or 4 competitors do, but did... I'm gonna differentiate myself. I'm gonna stand out by giving you a personal card, and this is what I write. You are a new customer, and we wanna make sure you're are welcome. So when you send your order, please en close this card. The writer wants wants to see that you get a gift with the order, something you can keep. That is Est Lau sales technique of the century that is a gift with purchase is what he's saying. What? And so now Hopkins is analyzing the psychology behind this simple little card that magnified this person's sales and had him out compete people that are very similar to him. They offer ra curiosity. It gave preference to his catalog. Without some compelling reason for ordering elsewhere, the customer would send the order to him, the gift paid for itself several times over by bringing larger sales per catalog now. That's wild. Take this out. The gift paid for itself several times over by bringing larger sales per catalog in in her, excuse me. My voice is going in her auto. She talks about. She's like, I'm not. She reduced her advertising budget. And because they had a limited amount of money at the beginning of the company. Right? So she reduced their advertising budget, and she says when in advertising. Let's spend money on more product... Manufacturing more products that we can give away. And what she found was that the gift with purchase, spending every dollar that she spent on on giving waste stuff as opposed to advertising, like, it outperformed the money spent on advertising. And so that's... That these people would constantly be coming back. And so I just thought that was, like, a very interesting idea. Like, okay. I'm gonna limit how much I'm spending on advertising, and I'm just gonna cultivate and my already existing customer base, and they're gonna grow because now they come back, but they tell other people about the products app for sale. And so Hopkins talks about, you know, the the the return on that investment, the gift paid, if you think think about it not as a gift, but as an investment, or even maybe you think about as marketing advertising, whatever you wanna put on it, the gift paid, the marketing paid, the advertising paid for itself several times over by bringing larger sales per catalog. And then he closes with the chapter called good business, and he's just talking about, like, the stuff we've talked about here. It's just a very beginning days. It's only going to grow more important time. A rapid stream ramp, and this is a very fascinating analogy that really in my mind crystallize what he's telling us. A rapid stream stream ran by my boy home. The stream turned a wooden wheel and the wheel ran a mill. Under that primitive method, all but a fraction of the stream potential went to waste, then someone applied scientific methods to the stream. Put in a turbine and die... And d. Now with no more water. No more power, it runs a large manufacturing plant. We think of that stream when we see wasted advertising power, and we see it everywhere. Hundreds of examples, enormous potentials millions of circulation used to turn a mill wheel while others use that same power with man effect. And now it's just a perfect analogy to end it you're advertising the way you market to customers, you can you can be the the same stream. Right? You can have a wooden wheel, and you can run a mill, or you can have a term turbine and d, and you can run a manufacturing plan. That sentence. Well others use that same power with man effect. And that is where I'll leave it. It's... I think it's a no brainer to buy this book. You can buy the paper version. If you... I think it's less than 10 dollars. It's insane. But if you buy... If you're interested in reading his auto, the My life in advertising, if you go on Amazon and search for the Kindle version, you can find a version of his auto where you get this scientific advertising book for free as well. But in either case, whether you read the auto, or you... I would read this book no matter what. I do think the auto is also interesting because it talks about the lessons that are in this book applied to his actual life. And I'm pretty sure this founders 1 70 if you haven't gone back to listen to that. I will leave a link in the show notes if you wanna support the podcast at the same time, and by the book. Use that link. That is 207 books down 1000 to go, and I'll to you again soon."
