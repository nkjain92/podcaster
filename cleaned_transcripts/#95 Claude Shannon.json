  "transcript": "Is value in rethinking Claude Shannon, but not in the way we'd imagine. Consider him not only as a distant fore father of the digital era, but is 1 of the great creative generalist of the twentieth century. Not solely as someone who laid the foundation of the information age, but as someone who trained a powerful intellect on topics of deep interest and continue to do so beyond the point of short term practicality. What can we learn from that claude Shannon? For 1 thing, Shannon body of work is a useful corrective to our era of unprecedented specialization. His work is wide ranging in the best sense and perhaps more than any twentieth century intellect comparable stature, he resists easy categorization. Was he a mathematician? Yes. Was an engineer? Yes. Was he a juggle uni cyclist, mach, fu, and Gambler. Yes. Shannon never acknowledged the contradiction in his fields of interests. He simply went wherever his curiosity led him. So is entirely consistent for him to jump from information dairy to artificial intelligence to chess to juggling, to gambling. It simply didn't occur to him that investing his talents in a single field made any sense at all. There were links from field to field, of course. And it goes without saying that Shannon understood the the bridges between his work and information theory and his work on robotics and investing in computer chess. Few have had a better intuitive sense of how the information revolution would fundamentally alter our world in all its aspects. But that sense led Shannon to choose exploration rather than specialization. This ind to seeming contradiction extended to the way he lived his life. He had the options of worldwide fame, yet he preferred to remain largely anonymous. He wrote path breaking papers, then unsatisfied with their present state, postpone them indefinitely in favor of more pressing. He made himself wealthy by studying markets and the potential startups. Yet he lived with cons modest. He reached the heights of the ivory tower with all the laurel and professional chairs to prove it, but felt no shame playing games built for children and writing poems on juggling. He was passionately curious, but also at times, una lazy. He was among the most productive, honored minds of his era and yet he gave the appearance that he would chuck it all overboard for the chance to tinker in his gadget room. K. So that's an excerpt from the book, and probably the best few paragraph summary I've I found of the life of Claude Shannon, but that comes from the book that I read this week and the 1 I'm gonna talk to you about today, which is a mind at play. How Claude Shannon invented the information age and it was written by Jimmy Sony and Rob Goodman. So let me go ahead and jump into the book. I don't wanna waste any more time. I wanna connect this book to the ones this the series I've been doing going back to Founders number 88, we started with the warren Buffett shareholder letters. Right? So, last week, her 2 weeks ago, I talked about Ed thor, the week before that, I talked about Claude shannon N at thor working together. So anything I've covered in the past podcast, I'm gonna try not to cover here. Okay. But I do wanna link this 1 where, when this book came out because this books... This is different than than usually, you know, I do fairly older books. This is a relatively new book. I think it was published in 2017. When it came out, Ed Dora who's still alive, tweeted the following recommendation for this book, and I just wanna read it to you real quick. He says, Claude Shannon was to information and communication what Newton was to physics. By following his curiosity through the playground of science. He discovered mathematical laws that govern our digital age. The Shannon I worked with comes alive in these pages. Okay. And then also before I jump back into the book, I want... Some people like, well, this is founders. Call shannon is not really. He didn't... He never found it a company. Yes. That's true, but he was an investor. To the point where he has he has a quote in the book where says, I make my money on the stock market. I don't make it by proving theorem. So even if he didn't start a company, I do consider investors entrepreneurs, he thinks like an entrepreneur. And I think that is... It's an analogy. It's worth our, like, the way his mind works is valuable for entrepreneurs to understand. So that's why I'm doing a podcast on them, other than that, he's just a fascinating person, and a lot of us are building companies on top of, you know, the technologies that he helped Pioneer So it's a very important And I, like I covered on the when I covered Fortune formula, Clutch and had 1 of the best investing records of all time. I think they they compared, like, a 1000 and, like, 25 different investment managers. You know, this is professional managers doing a full time, hundreds of researchers. They have all kinds of resources, and, Shannon investment returns were better than all than 1, and he did it part time with his wife on an Apple to computer. So I kinda gives you the the person we're dealing with here. And I'll I'll talk a little bit more about how he thought about that later on the podcast. First, this podcast may seem like a little bit of, like, a bunch of non s. It's just... There's no easy way to summarize call Shannon. So I I lean heavily when I finish reading the book, what I realized is like, we really have to understand him as a person. And then I feel like the the authors did a fantastic job of explaining him as a person, Then his ideas and his approached life completely makes sense and a clicks. So I wanna start just talking a little bit about his personality. And these are just random quotes I found scattered throughout the book that I collect in 1 area. So he says, he was a man immune to scientific fashion and insulated from opinion of all kinds, on all subjects, even himself, but especially himself. A man of closed doors and long silence who thought his best thoughts and spartan bachelor apartments and empty office buildings. This a actually a really important point. He... Just like when I talked about last week, with Henry Singleton, they have the ability to to eliminate all distractions. They're completely comfortable just being alone with their own thoughts, coming with their own reasoning and then just believing in that reasoning. And I think that's especially hard. I'm speaking for my own personal experience, like, especially hard in today's age where we have access to all kinds of different interesting information. And sometimes it's good to just close that off and just be alone with your thoughts for a long period of time. He never argued his ideas. If people didn't believe in them, he ignored those people. He could neither explain himself to others nor cared to. In his work life, he preferred sol and kept his professional associations to a minimum that might be linked to his ability to to to avoid distractions. He was terribly terribly secretive. He was not someone who would listen to other people about what to work on. Now here's a little short story that gives you further insights his personality. Says having completed his path breaking work by the age of 22, he might have spent his remaining decades as a scientific celebrity. Instead, he spent them tinkering. He was super famous, famous, maybe not to the general population, but maybe... Yeah, maybe even to the general population. When he was alive though. He was covered in all kinds of magazines. He was offered all kinds of jobs, speeches that he declined. He met with presidents and was honored... He had they just a room full of awards that he didn't really care about. So what we mean by celebrity. So he might have spent his time remaining decades is a scientific celebrity. Instead, he spent them tinkering an electronic maze solving mouse, an e set turtle that walked his house. The first plan for a chess playing computer. A distant ancestor of Ip d blue, The first ever wearable computer, a calculator that operated in roman numerals, a fleet of customized uni cycles. Years devoted to the scientific study of jung Rarely has a thinker who devoted his life to the study of communication been so un. A man almost entirely written out of history defined by self promoter. He's... His was a life spent in the pursuit of curious, serious play. That's why the book is called a mine plane. And might be 1 of the... If not, the main ish, the main takeaway from book, 1 of the main takeaways from the book. The fact that, a, a life well lived is 1 spent doing exactly what you wanna do for its own sake. He was that rare scientific genius who was justice content rigging up a juggling robot or a flame throwing Trumpet as he was pioneering digital circuits. It is another great lesson. Something I need to apply because I... Sometimes I take life a little too serious, and you have to remember to to enjoy it. He says, he worked with Levi and played with gravity. He never acknowledged a distinction between the 2. That's just a fantastic sentence. So he's obviously really famous our what but best well known as the father of and the creator of information theory. Information there to me is really hard to describe I've read about us a bunch of it. I still don't understand. I'm gonna give you 3 different descriptions here. That hopefully, like, fill in the gaps. And by filling in the gaps, you understand why he's so important. So there's just 1 sentence in summary in the book says all the advanced single signal processing that enables us to send high speed data was done as an outgrow of claude shannon work on information theory. This is more of a technical definition It says information theory information theory studies, the quantification, storage and communication of information. The field is at the intersection, this is the 1 of the crazy sentences. The field is that the intersections of mathematics, statistics, computer science, physics, neuro, information engineering, and electrical engineering. The theory has also found practical applications and other areas. There's, like a huge list I'm just gonna name some of them. Including statistical interference, are inference, sorry. Natural language processing, crypto, neuro, human vision, and the evolution and function of molecular codes. It's 1 of the most cited papers of all time. And I'd I'm just gonna leave this section with the Way claude shannon described it. He... 1 thing another thing I learned from him is that he had a unbelievable, belief and talent to getting to, like, the simplicity the the the... Like, the heart of simplicity of an issue. So this is... You'll see this. He says claude... I says Claude Shannon described it, meaning information theory as a technical tool for communication engineers. Alright. So I wanna go a little bit into his young into his early life. He's really resourceful. Like, almost every single... Not almost. Every single person I've covered on this podcast has that trait. They are resourceful. So he's resourceful young age. Talks about, he grew up in this tiny tiny town in Michigan, and it says, giving us a description of the scenery says barb wire runs along the roads in between the pastures and claude Shannon walks defenses, 1 half mile stretch fence, especially. This is this is his 1 half mile stretch fence outside of his house. Claude stretch is electric. He charged it himself. He hooked up dry cell batteries at each end and splice spare wire into any gaps to run the current unbroken. He's like, 8 or 9, maybe 10 years always doing this. Insulation was anything at hand, leather straps, glass bottlenecks, corn cob, inner 2 pieces. Keypad at... Now why is he doing this? Keypad at each end, 1 of his house and the other at his friend's house, half a mile away, made it a private barb wire telegraph. 1 thing to note is, you know, he didn't... There's a lot of people that that Go to achieve great things and they they have a lot of you know, adversity, usually, just crazy things happened to them. Shannon had a pretty ordinary childhood. So the authors are gonna talk about that here. He says biographies of geniuses often opened a stories of over z parenting. We think of Beethoven father, beating his son into the shape of a prodigy. Our John Stuart Mills father drilling his son is in Greek at the age of 3. Our Nor Wei father, declaring to the world that he could turn anything even a broom into a genius with enough time and discipline. Compared to those childhood, Shannon was ordinary, there was no indication of over bearing parental pressure. And if you showed any early signs of genius, they were not memorable enough to to have been written down. Something else I learned from Claude Shannon, and I'm gonna put it in the words of Charlie Mu is the value in following your natural drift. So let me just read this part from the book, and I'll explain how it relates to Mu pinging on this. He says reflecting on his education with the benefit of hindsight Shannon would say that his interest in mathematics had a simple source. It just came easily to him. This is a direct quote from Shannon. He says, I think 1 tends to get into work that you find easy for yourself, and that's a reoccurring theme throughout the book. And it reminds me of when Charlie Mu gave a commencement address. So he he went to law school by, by some accounts, he was 1 of the smartest people ever went to Harvard law school. And yet he didn't work as an attorney. And so he's given a commencement address to law graduates at Usc about a decade back, and he says something really interesting. So he says, he was given this advice, and he says, Charlie tells a story of a friend who worked a law firm. He knew too much and it showed. He was till... He was told by his bosses. Your duty is to behave in such a way that the client thinks he's the smartest person in the world. Then you make your senior partner think he is the smartest... Hit this person in the world and then so on and so forth. Right? So basically, don't don't shine too bright, give the credits to other people of your ideas. Knowing Charlie Mu, there's just 0 chance he's gonna do that. He says, I didn't do this. I always obeyed the drift of my nature. If other people didn't like it, Well, I don't need to be adored by everybody. That sentence could easily been said by by Claude shannon. He was pretty indifferent. He's just gonna do what he... Now, what he naturally wanted to do. And if he didn't like it too bad. I also think that's that's probably a key in having, like, getting to of your life and being satisfied. I think, when you when you study, like, the the regrets of people near near the end of their life, They're saying, you know, I I lived... I let other people people's opinion influence like my decisions too much. By that time, it's too late, unfortunately. Another insight into the personality and and mind of claude Shannon which might seem like, might not it might not make any sense. The first of him here this, but he was not... He would reject certain certain fields of study. If it had too many facts and not enough principles. So Shannon like Mu, love to build models, and he like to take, Mu would say, you know, why am I just gonna master the the best ideas in in in my field, I'd rather look in other fields and see what the other people masked and then combine the 2, Shannon very much did the same thing. And so here's Shannon on the fact that he didn't, like, fields where there's too many facts. He says he he loves science, but dislike facts. Or rather, he dislike the kinds of facts that you couldn't bring under a rule and abstract his way out of. Chemistry in particular tested his patients. He says it always seemed a little dull, too many isolated facts in too few general principles for my taste. Something else know about claude Shannon is, you know, everybody has people they look up to, call Shannon was no different. The person he the most with Thomas Edison, which kinda makes Shannon lifelong desire to spend most of his time tinkering. Makes a lot of sense because, you know, Edison was known for that as well. Shannon was also very indecisive. And, you know, sometimes, that's portrayed is like, a negative trait. I definitely feel I'm indecisive at times, and I don't like that. As Shannon it winds up inadvertently helping him later in life. So at this the the part about to reach you, he's in college at the University of Michigan, and he can't decide whether he wants to to major in mathematics or engineering, so he just does both. And he says by the time Shannon began his dual degrees in mathematics and engineering, a generation later, the 2 curriculum had largely merged to 1. That appealed to Shannon who admitted that his choice of a dual degree wasn't part of a grand design for his career. It was simply at a adolescent indecision. I wasn't really quite sure what I like best he called. Shannon variety of in indecision, which he never entirely grew. No. That's for sure. Would prove crucial to his later work. Someone content to build things might have been happy with a single degree engineering. Someone drawn more to theory might have been satisfied with studying Math alone. Shannon mathematically and mechanically inclined could not make up his mind. But the result left him trained in 2 fields that would prove essential to his later success. So he this winds up directly leading to 1 of the most... I'm gonna tell you about 1... I would say... I'm gonna say it's the most important point in Chan life. And let me just get to it right now. So he's he's in dual... Not only is he comp... He's about to complete both degrees, but he's doing a lot of work in his own time. And he starts publishing papers. And that gets him once leading to a job, which which is what I consider the most important turning point in Shannon life. It says his first publications tell us something about his growing ambition. Taking time out from the usual burdens of classes and college life to study these problems, Work out the answers and prepare them for publication suggests that he already envisioned something other for himself than the family furniture business. His something other would begin with a typed postcard tacked to an engineering Bulletin board. It was an invitation to come east and help build a mechanical brain. Shannon noticed it in the spring of 19 36, That's where we were in the story. Just as you was considering what was to come after his undergraduate days was over. Didn't know what he's gonna do. Lucky he he sees this job offer. And says this is the job. Matt... Yeah, to become a master student and assistant on the differential analyzer at Mit. It was Taylor made for a young man who could find equal joy in equations and construction thinking and building. Also, somebody that would be comfortable just sitting in a room by himself for the machine. I pushed hard for that job, and I got it. That was 1 of the luck things of my life Shannon later said. Luck may have played a role, but the applications acceptance was also a testament to the keen eye of a figure who would shape the rest of Shannon life and the course of American science. So this is where we're introduced to person that built the differential analyzer. Right? 1 of the most important figures in American history and the a lifelong mentor for Shannon. Van Bush. Now, I didn't know who this guy was. So you might be asking who is Van Bush. I'm just gonna give you... He's also... When you realize after I read this to you realize he's he's he has to be a a future episode of founders, who is Van bush. Van bush is a man who would provide over a custom made brain, the size of a room. He'd counsel presidents. He'd direct the nation's scientist to World War 2. He was called the man who may win or lose the war and the general of physics and least Among leased and not least among these accomplishments would be this. He'd be the first to see Claude Shannon for who he was. He's also the cofounder of Ray, which the gigantic defense contractor that still exists to this day. I just looked it up I think they're doing, like, 20 to 30000000000 in revenue, as of 2018. So I've mentioned that the word differential analyzer, which is what Shannon is gonna be working on. You probably wanna know what that is. It was a brain the size of a room. A metal calculus machine that could work away at a problem for days and nights on and before ground to a halt. 1 problem, which measured the effects of the earth's magnetic field on cosmic rays took 30 weeks of spinning gears. But when it was done, the differential analyzer had solved by brute force equation so complex that even trying to attack them with human brain power would have been pointless. Another way to think about that is this was a computer before the digital revolution. Was an analog computers like a a cra way of describing it. There's actually pictures in the book of it. I... I... I'm kind of embarrassed by my initial thought when I looked at it. It looks like a really long... Like, you ever seeing a fo ball table. Like, it looks like 1 that's the size of a room with a bunch of cabinets on the side. I was kind of embarrassed. So that that just the first thought that cut popped to my mind. Okay. So around this time, this work on the differential analyzer, it's is what causes him to write the paper, which becomes a foundation for information, theory, and this is kind of the result of this time in his life. And I'm giving, like, a very very brief. Like, this is not at all a complete thought here. It's very brief. So you kind of understand I can move the story along. So he says, Here with Shannon Shut room with a machine built to automate thought. K? So this is an experience, the experience he's going through as a byproduct of his day job and how it relates to own thoughts and ideas that eventually turn into information theory. And in the midst of his work, he came to understand 80 knew another way of automating thought. Remember, he he reasons by analogy a lot. That's how he thought. And then he would think in abstraction. 1 that would ultimately prove far more powerful than the analog machine, so he's essentially turning analog computations to digital computation. Okay? Logic, and this isn't another idea from Shannon that I never even thought about. This this isn't to this part. Logic just like a machine was a tool for democrat force. Built with enough enough precision and skill it can multiply the power of the gifted and the average alike. So we understand this idea of, like, the bicycle, the computer being a bicycle friend of mine. Right? Popularized by Steve Jobs back in the 19 seventies. I never thought of logic, which is Shannon point is like the under underlying like, result of, like, what you're building computation on on, even if it didn't have a machine, like, getting your your thought process and your brain used to using logic as a tool. And that being analogous to a machine that could democrat force, meaning that, like, if you have somebody that's not a adept to using logic, and you're... They're they're able to be trained to. That actually winds up multiplying the power of, like, their skills. So like adding leverage to. It's very interesting. I I never thought about that before. So I wanted include that part. Maybe it makes sense to you too. Less than a decade after Shannon paper, the great analog machine This is the result of Thesis, by the way, The differential analyzer was effectively obsolete, replaced by digital computers that could do its work literally a thousand times faster answering questions in real time. The medium was now vacuum tubes. These are early computers, not switches, but the design was a direct descendant of Shannon discovery. Okay. So that's the results of his work, but I thought it was very very interesting actually... I, I wanna tell you how he worked in this process. So this is especially how he worked in his twenties. He was a tinker to the end of his life, and he worked with his hands long after he he had any need to. But unlike other tinker, he had a way of getting behind things. He loved the objects under his hand, right up to the point when he abstract his way past them. Switches weren't just switches, Men his time working with a differential analyzer, but a metaphor for math, There had been legions of juggle and uni cycle riders in the world, but few were as compelled as Shannon would be to fit those activities into equations. Most important all, he would abstract his way past all human communication to the structure informed that every message holds in common. In all these endeavors, he was distinguished less by quantitative horsepower, than by his mastery of model making, the reduction of big problems to their essential core. And I think this is why actually study, cloud Shannon, because that's what you're trying to do. You're... If you're building a business, like you're engaged in a complex adaptive their system it's very difficult, very complex. It's unpredictable. And the the reason a lot of people that have in the past to found the companies recommend that if you're gonna build a business like to understand the the the benefits of building models inside your head is because it helps do what Shannon doing here. In other domains, it's reducing big problems to their essential core. Shannon work at 21 was a window of all the work he had left. In his twenties, his most productive years, he took his abstraction to the point of deep withdrawal and almost crippling shy. And in this deep withdrawal is when he writes the paper, that that information theory is based on, it's called a mathematical theory of, on communication or of communication, and then the very next year, it's changed to the mathematical theory. Of communication. And what was interesting about that is he just kinda, he had given small hints of about he's working on. But the... In the book that they just talked about like, he just just basically dropped the paper, publishes it in, a technical journal. And people are like, whoa, what the hell... Where did this come from? It came out of nowhere. Alright. So this... The note of myself is this might be the main takeaway from the book. And it's the last sentence I'm gonna read you. So it says, what's what's your secret remaining so care free an interviewer As Shannon towards the end of his life? Shannon answered, I do what comes naturally and usefulness is not my main goal. It's a very interesting sentence. Right? I keep asking myself how would you do this? Is it possible to make a machine do that? Can you prove this theorem? So you just like, it comes from curiosity. Right? This the main point. For an abstract man at his most content the world isn't there to be used, but to be played with, manipulated by hand and mind. I love that idea. There's another interesting thing. So while he's in school, Shannon learned how to fly. Right? He wants to become a pilot. Then the flight instructor. This is 1 of the craziest things in the book. The flight instructor tries to get him to stop because he they didn't... He he thought Shannon was a genius and didn't want Shannon to die. So he writes a letter. The flight instructor writes a letter to the president at Mit. And he says I'm convinced that Shannon is not only unusual, but it's in fact, a near genius of most unusual promise. With the president's permission he would ban Shannon from the cockpit. Such a life wasn't worth risking in a crash. And the president sent a letter letter back. That was more level headed. He said somehow I doubt the advise of urging a young man to refrain from flying or arbitrary to take away the opportunity to take this opportunity away from him on the grounds of his being intellectually superior. I don't... I doubt whether it it'd be good for his development. So he's a he's a allowed to fly. I just thought it was funny. But the flight instructor is not the only 1 to think of Shannon as, like, a a universal genius. Right? Van Bush thinks about this. And he... Remember I mentioned earlier, he is a huge influence on on Shannon life. It says Bush believe Shannon to be an almost universal genius whose talents might be channel in any direction. And Shannon had a lot of respect for Van bush. So he you kind of ignored everybody else to some degree, but he listened to and, especially when as a young man, basically followed what Bush thought he should do. The... And the reason I include that 1 sentence is because he shows that that ability when he starts studying stock market. So if you remember a Fortune formula, he said, okay. But... He he just got them saying he just... He does things for curiosity sake. So he thought Well, here's an idea. If you present the problem. Here's a problem I have. How can I make the most amount of money in the shortest amount of time? And that is what that 1 prompt sent Shannon out into figuring out. So he realized, okay, well the stock market that might be a mathematical problem. He winds up studying that. So to to put Bush's point where it's like, almost universal genius. Like, I don't think you have to be a genius to do this stuff. I mean, I'm not... Shannon, I definitely think it was. But I think that, it... This also applies to everybody. You might not be able to master, you know, bunch of different domains. But if you're really curious and driven, you can learn anything that you want to. And Shannon improve that. Like, the idea what referencing what I just told you before. Like, he... Later in his life, He doesn't do this still way later he gets such in the stock market, and and companies and and and creating wells. And he winds up doing it part time better than than the vast majority of people to do it full time It's really interesting. So I I'm gonna continue this whole bush and Shannon thought here for a few minutes because there's a lot interesting questions that are unanswered for me. And so this section I'm gonna read you is, like, my note myself was like, I wonder if Shannon was influenced by Bush's thought here or Did he already lean this way. And this is the idea that Shannon rejected, just like Bush did, specialization. It was a... Is a matter of deep conviction for bush that specialization was the death of genius. This has also been a a theme in the last few people that Have talked about on the podcast whether it's warren Buffett, Charlie Mu at Thor, Henry Singleton. They were not specialists. They applied their talents in many different domains just like Claude Shannon does. And so I now this is Bush a quote on this. He says in these days when there's a tendency to specialize so closely. He also didn't specialize. If you look at his his his wide very, his various accomplishments. It is well for us to be reminded that the possibilities of being at once broad and deep, did not pass with Vinci or Benjamin Franklin. And, like, those aren't the, you know, they have Vinci and Franklin had a bunch of different interest and they were able to master. Like, why can't we? Like, let's not over specialized what Bush is saying. And certainly Shannon life is like an illustration that. So I don't know if Shannon came up with that on his own or if he may have been influenced of by I thinking of bush. Now, it I wanna talk to you about this part Shannon life, which is weird. Shannon spent many years studying genetics. And that's because Bush wanted Shannon to study genetics. And this is the result. It says the project had been Bush's initiative, and the I... The hypothesis was his. Hypothesis. The subject, a 23 year old genius, working in a scientific field in which he has no training in which he did not even know what the word meant. Although the words meant. He didn't know any of the vocabulary genetics he had learned that. Can produce original findings in less than 1 year. Conclusion confirmed mostly. So he says him about study genetics like, hey. Just just plot... Just tell me what you can learn about this and do you have any unique insights? And Shannon winds up publishing several papers and they actually, like, does lead... He did have contributions for any short time setting. So that's what Bush wanted to. It's like, This guy can... If I if I direct his talents on any problem, he's gonna be able to figure it out. And, the reason I this up is because you see this in entrepreneurship a lot, someone succeeding and starting a business with no prior knowledge in that specific field. So there's some lessons there for us. This next section... Let me just read this to you. Shannon would be adamant on the point for the rest of his life that after the effort of discovery, which is doing for sake, the effort of communication, which the sake of others was secondary by far. He had once he had solved a problem to his own satisfaction. And after that, as far as he was concerned, it was enough. Shannon explained later. After I had found the answers, was always painful to write them up or publish them. But in his... What he's working at bell labs, working at Mit, that's how you get a claim. Shannon didn't care about a claim. I mean, you got it anyways, but he didn't he didn't go and seek it. So unless I took away from this was, like, working on what naturally interest you is time will spent. And I think if you can align your work with your interests, you're just gonna get more out of life. And I think, like, the whole point is, Shannon enjoyed his life. Like, he did go through. I'm gonna talk about, like, he he had a dark depressive period of time. So it's not like you used life was free from struggle. But other than that, like, he just... He enjoyed his time here. And I think so few people get to the end of their life actually enjoying it. So something that I was constantly reminded when Was reading his book. Oh, Shannon productivity hack These are just gonna be some... I have some random ideas and here Gonna share with you. This is 1 of them. This is a quote from him. I've been working on 3 different ideas simultaneously. And strangely enough, it seems a more productive method than sticking to 1 problem. After graduate work, he goes to work at Bell Labs. I might do a... There's a book on Bell. I think it's called Idea factory. That I might I might turn that into you. I might read the book and and discuss them on founders, because there's just so many people. That came out of there. And here's a description of bill labs, and you'll see why I think it might be worth us worth our time to study and learn about. He was headed to what was perhaps the world's foremost technology company. And the home, so he graduates from Mit. And now, now he's gonna go to work Bell labs. The home of the best communication lines in America. The goal of bell labs wasn't simply clear and faster phone calls. The labs were tasked with dreaming up the future in which every form of communication would be a machine aided endeavor. Isn't interesting that that's actually the world we live in now. Like they were successful in that. In the span of a few decades, Bell researchers engineered, the first ever long distance phone call, synchronized the sounds and images and movies and demonstrated some of the earliest facts and television systems. During the war, they they improved radar, sonar and the Ba. And they created a secure phone line connecting Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill that's Ci sally and that's what Shannon worked on too. I'll talk about that in a little bit. They would invent touch tone dialing and the solar solar battery cell, and they would pioneer the communication satellite and the transistor, which is the foundation of modern electronics. And this is what Shannon like. He worked the build outs for 15 years. And this is part of the reason why. I had the freedom to do anything I wanted from almost the day I started. They never told me what to work on. So if you we always think about this question, like, there's a lot of different reasons people wanna build their own business to become entrepreneurs. And my experience, I think, a lot of people think it's for money. Some people think it's for fame, which is weird because most entrepreneurs are 99.99 percent of them are anonymous. So I definitely disagree agree with that, but I think that if you had to isolate 1 reason is that is freedom. Or you can also say another words it's, like, control of your own life. Like, most pe... Most people to do this is, like, they want the freedom to choose what they work on, they want the freedom to, like, say when they work, they don't want other people telling them what to do. Shannon hated. And that's the his entire life, and you'll see that in some other decisions he makes his life is optimizing for freedom. Around this time, he's he's in the the the age where he could get drafted and that terrified him. He was a level 10 introvert. So 1 is a super ex and 10 is a super introvert. I would put Shannon on a level 10. You'll see this here. And this is also how he got out of the draft. His is him talking. He says if you can make yourself more useful somewhere else you won't get into the army. That seemed to me a wise move. A friend noted that Shannon, an introvert worried not only about the dangers of overseas deployment, but also the close quarters of for army life. I think he did... I think he did the work with that fear in mind that he might have to go into the army, which means being with lots of people being around lots of people, which he couldn't stand. He was pho about crowds and people he didn't know. He would, like any of his generation put his mind rather than his body to work on the country's behalf. He's laid on his life. Eventually leaves bill labs and goes to become a professor at Mit. And yet he's barely there. He does most of his work at home. They say, like, he's a very nice person, but he'll will never... Like, he'll never engage in conversation. You have to come to him sort of conversation, and he'll, you know, he'll reciprocate he'll talk to you. But he other than that, he preferred sol to. And his main, collaborator in his life was his second wife. Alright. So what how did he put his mind to work for the country during world war 2? They they had a bunch of hard problems to solve? Remember, it was it was unclear. If you study World war 2? Like, you know, the the the the Nazis were just kinda running rough shot over everybody. Dominating everybody. And so there was a lot of, like, activity before America officially declared for the war. Was largely trying to prepare for what they saw is like, a very formidable adversary. And so 1 of the things that he helped contribute to was this idea of fire control. And so let me tell you what Fire control. He says fire control was essentially the study of hitting moving targets. The targets were anything and everything the enemy could hurt through the air to cause damage. Planes, rockets, ballistic. They essentially turning this until a math problem. So he says imagine a gun firing a single shot at a target. Now imagine that the gun is the size of a 2 story house that it's placed on a moving navy ship in the middle of an ocean and is trying to shoot down an emmy enemy fighter, moving at 350 miles per hour. That was a rough description of the challenge of fire control. Now it's interesting this. He he does a lot of great work for the war. But he's doing this while he's broken personally. He gets divorced, and he's going through a very dark and depressive time in his life. Says the accounts of that of that time depict a man on edge and understandably so. The pressure of the war combined with the collapse of his marriage had left Shannon shattered. Looked like he might be... He might completely crack up nervous and emotionally. This is also, he's he's forced to work on teams, which he doesn't like. He says, this is... The whole atmosphere left a bitter taste in his mouth. The secrecy, the intensity, the dr, the obligatory teamwork All of it seem to have gotten to him in a deeply personal way. In addition to Fire control, he's I made a lot of advancements in crypto photography, which is what 6 Alley was. It's the first ones being the first way to securely place a call, across Atlantic Ocean. And during this time, I'm not gonna talk about it. And today, but in the book, he strikes up a a friendship with Alan Turing as well. So it talks about, crypto photography was the war was the war white noise. It was ubiquitous and yet only those playing closest attention could pick it up. It was 1 of the least understood components of the war machine compared to say the nuclear bomb, which is a visible, white hot expression of the power of physics. The products of crypto crypto graphic analysis, analysts. Excuse me. Were arc cane and mysterious and kept classified for a generation or more. So so working on. I talked a little bit about Ci sally on the the podcast I did on Fortune 4. I'm just gonna... I'm not gonna Trying not to repeat myself here, but says 6 Alley, looked like a character... This is what it actually physically looks like. It was a character of a mid century computer. It occupied... It occupied an entire room, demanded round the clock air conditioning and produce small outputs for the enormous inputs it acquired. None of that mattered. The only thing it mattered was for the first time, secret speech could cross the Atlantic. So that's where, before, there's been many times where the Germans were able to tap into conversations between Churchill and Roosevelt, and then get, you know, strategic value information that helped them on the battlefield. So Shannon was played a role. It was, like, 30 something other people working on the project, but he played a role in and in stopping that. Now the reason I bring up his timing in crypto photography is because he has a reoccurring theme here I think it's important for us to understand, he's able to take many different ideas from unrelated fields and see how they can relate. And he seems to fought to do this over and over and over again. And essentially he nothing all the experiences and and stuff he studies like, nothing is wasted. He uses them. He breaks them into analog and bits and and and recon them later on in life, which I think is fascinating. Shannon crypto crypto work was released into the dark of the intelligence apparatus. A world of classifications in secrecy where the works reception was concealed even from its author. Of the of the people in the world of this world, Shannon would say they're they are not a very talk bunch. You could say, that they're are the most secretive bunch of people in the world. Now... So that's interesting, but this is the most important part. Is the work's true importance in the end, was not in the creation of an invisible code, but rather the way it suppressed insights ultimately res resurfaced at the heart of Shannon revolutionary theory of information. And he says on this, it was a great flow of ideas from 1 to the other. Back and forth. So was the main benefit he got from working on that. So well, let me just read it. So now this is about the important. Like, you know, everybody's gonna be influenced by somebody. Right? So Shannon was influenced by this dis person named Ralph Hart. And it says reading the work of Ralph Hart, Shannon said was an important influence on my life. Not simply in the research of his studies. Shannon spent much of his life working with the conceptual tools that hart built And for the better part of his life, much of his public identity, Claude Shannon, father of information theory was bound up and having been the 1 who extended Hart idea far beyond would hart or anyone else could have imagined. So what does that mean? It means that Claude Shannon didn't invent information terry from Whole cloth. He extended the work of of the people that inspired him before. Now we've seen this a lot. We just saw this last week. Like, I'm thinking all these ideas that I'm reading for warren buffett come from Warren Buffett, then you realized, oh, my god. He got these ideas from Henry Singleton. Same thing. I thought all these... I'm reading all these biographies on Steve jobs. Like wow, that's good idea. Then I read a bio Edwin Land. I'm like, oh, wait. Jobs got that from land. And then same thing I learned from Jeff Bezos and I realized, oh, he got that I deal from Sam Walton and Jim Pinnacle. So the point is they all take ideas from the past and extend them in the future. And then by doing that you get different results. So I think it's a really interesting point. This another another reminder to follow your natural drift. Shannon made a principle ind. It was central to occur in which he chases instincts, often need the expense of more prestigious or more financially valuable options. This is something we saw Thor do as well. And was just like I I turned down business opportunities I I were certain to make a lot of money on because 1 I already had more money I could spend. And 2, I valued other things in life, like spending time with family and learning. So we're seeing same thing with Shannon here. Unlike many scientists who probably successful research careers into lives as public intellectual He did not seem to consider uses using his growing standing within the world of science it's an opportunity to expand his network outside of it. Of anything, he closed himself off further, ignoring letters, colleagues and projects and spending his time and attention absorbed by the puzzles that interested in him the most. This is him following his natural drift. He was just really literally following his natural curiosity. And then he says something. This throw away quote, which I think is 1 of the most important quotes in the entire book. He says, I think the history of science has shown that valuable consequences often proliferate from simple curiosity. I love that sentence. So skipping ahead the story, he winds up leaving bell labs for Mit. And so this is also an understanding of, like, why why would he do that? He's... And he's got a couple good advice, like, things that we could take away our own lives here. When an offer came to be a professor at Mit, it was hard to decline. For for all the pool of University life, Shannon struggle with his choice. He's got 2 great options. Stay in Rural New Jersey at Bell Labs, or go move to to Massachusetts and work at Mit. Bill Labs has been his professional home for more than 15 years. It had been the site of his most productive years as a researcher and thinker. It had afforded him unheard of intellectual freedom and supported him. Bell labs somewhat remote location in Jersey was a complicating factor in its own rights. So he's talking about there's there's a good to that, but also negative. He's gonna tell us why that... What why that's the case here. The essential seclusion and isolation of Bell Labs had both advantages and disadvantages. That's direct from Shannon it eliminates a good many time wasting visitors, but at the same time, prevents many interesting contacts. She's going back and forth making this decision. He continues. Foreign visitors often spend a day of bell bell labs. But they spend 6 months at Mit. This gives me opportunities for real interchange of ideas. In the end, the general freedom in academic life in my view is 1 of the most important features. See him optimizing for freedom again. The long vacations are exceedingly attractive, and is also the general feeling of freedom in the hours of work. There was also 1 decisive factor pulling Shannon into Mit. A certain restless on Shannon part after spending more than and a half in a single institution. This is what I mean, I think this is actually really important. Having spent 15 years bill labs, Shannon Writes, I fell myself getting a little stale and unproductive and a change of seen and of colleagues is very stimulating. That's why you might... If you're feeling that you're in a scale environment with the ideas or maybe just your personal dissatisfaction, like, you might wanna change things up, like, your physical, like, where you physically or has an impact on that. And this is the impact the the changes of scenery worked. Now we start to see his mind in full bloom. What, resulted were some of Shannon most creative and Whim endeavors. There was a Trump the shot fire out of its bell when played. The handmade uni cycles in every perm experimentation, a uni cycle and no seat, a uni cycle no pedals, a uni cycle bill for 2. There was a chair lift that took surprise guests down from the house house's porch to the edge of the lake. This is all the stuff he's building. A machine that solved Rubik's cubes. Chest playing machines, handmade robots being and small. Shannon mind at scene was finally free to bring its most outlandish ish ideas to mechanical life. And, this is another thing. I I think a lesson we need to apply our own lives. His activities were auto. And the definition of Auto is an activity or creative work having an end or purpose of itself. And the reason I know that word is because I originally started this podcast. It wasn't called Founders podcast. If you look at the description, like the link when you share it, from, like, Apple podcasts in the Apple Podcast directory. It's... The name of the podcast was Auto tel first. Because at the time I had AAA newsletter that dealt with book recommendations and stuff I was wondering from books. It's kinda like, early, and, like, predecessor to what I'm doing now. And I started. Some of the early... Some of the people listen founders now were on that list. So I jump started this podcast because I already had, you know, several thousands people on that list. Said, hey, I'm gonna chart. I'm gonna start doing a podcast where I talk about books. IIII read and, like, what I learned from them, and I was doing just books... I it wasn't just biographies at the time. So I really like this the idea of, like, having something your life, and hopefully, it's the work you're doing too. I mean, that's that's, like, the perfect like, be be that'd be like, the the best option, but just understanding, like, there's certain things you're doing in your life that you just do to do it. Like, you're not... You might not be doing it for money. Right? You just... You because you enjoy doing them. And so Shannon has that, and he talked about. He says looking back Shannon summed it all up as happily pointless. I've always pursued my interest without much regard to financial value or value to the world. I spent lots of time on totally useless things. Telling, he made no distinction between his interest and information and his interest in uni cycles. They were all moves in the same game. And I think that's more of how we actually experience life. Like, we don't have these hard separation from a lot of things in life. I... Because I don't think that's how we experience it. Wake, We just... It's just 1 vast experience over however long you have on this earth and same person that could be, like, in the shannon case, Like, There's he was... Doesn't mean he was an serious person. Like, he made very important breakthrough, scientific breakthroughs. But at the same time, he saw no difference between... He did that because it's interested in him. Just like, they looking at the active juggling as a mathematical problem interested him. Just like when you went to Las Vegas with Thor to try with the first handmade computer because it's just interesting. Could I build a computer that beats Ro? So, again, I think that's, like, the main takeaway from Shannon and, like, hopefully they influence he has on all of us moving forward. And I'm gonna talk a little bit about, this is his daughter on the family hobby of investing. And so he was 1 of the most successful investors ever, but he's also un serious it. In the sense like he thought it was fun. Like it was playful. Was a problem he had to solve. It was curious He was drawn to him. It says in the 19 sixties the seventies Betty and Claude did play the market obsessively. The process became a family affair. This is her his daughter Peggy talking. Much of the conversation around the home would be of the stock market. Much of my parents focus was on what the market was doing. They taught me to read the Wall Street Journal and stocks very early. It was a great way to cage kids. They eventually set up a small personal computer to carry the quotes during the day, and then check again at the end of the day. So there are computer printout outs floating around the house with stock quotes on them. And again, Tying all altogether. His interest in money resembled his other passions. That's what I mean, is like no separation. He was not out to accrue wealth for wealth shakes nor but he did die a very wealthy man. Nor did he have any burning desire to own the finer things in life. But money created markets and math puzzles. Problems that could be analyzed and interpreted and even played out. Now 1 of these investments is Tele, which I covered last week. And if you haven't listened to it. Please listen to it. Warren Buffett says that that Henry Singleton, the founder of Tele has the single best record in all of American business. Think about how all the different companies that have been built, in America unless, let's say, hundred and 50 years. That's a hell of a statement. Tele I grew to become a multi billion dollar conglomerate, and Henry Singleton a hell of a person. Shannon made the investments simply because I had a good opinion of them. They knew each other. His investment in Tele achieved an annual compound return of 27 percent over 25 years. So that's just... That's Charlie Mu talks about that return. He said calls it utterly ridiculous. If you invested a dollar with with... Let's see say you invested a million dollars with Henry Singleton. When he first started his career, 30 years later, he'd returned a hundred and 80000000 dollars to you. Their colonel of interest in the market, meaning Claude and his wife, Betty. Their colonel interest in the market grew into consuming hobby. The 2 of them began devour books on trading, contemplating various market philosophies and graph possible scenarios for stocks. They studied many of history's most successful investors, including Bernard, Bar, heavy Green and Benjamin Grand. They read Adam Smith's to Wealth of Nations and studied Von Neumann and Oscar Morgan work on game theory. If you really think about it. We're we're doing something very similar here, but for entrepreneurs. But a lot of people thought, like, so chan well, the... His most attended lecture ever was when he started talking about the stock market. I was like, oh, this is a mathematical genius. He must have has this, like, algorithm and he can predict everything. No. That's he realized you couldn't do that. And so this is his approach and I found fascinating. Complicated formulas mattered a great deal less, Shannon argued, than the accompanies people and the product. He went on. A lot of people look at the stock price when they should be looking at the basic earnings out of the basic company in its earnings. There are many problems concerned with the prediction of s sarcastic processes. For examples, the earnings of com companies what he's talking about is that this is far too complex. My general feelings is that it's easier to choose companies which are going to succeed than to predict short term variations, things that will last only weeks or months, which they worry about down on Wall Street. There's is a lot more randomness there and things happen which you cannot predict, which cause people to sell or buy a lot of stock. It was his view that market timing and tricky mathematics were no match for a solid company with strong growth prospects and sound leadership. And this is also something that we've we've heard a lot in the last few weeks from Buffett and mon I think they would agree with his statement there. Something I also wanna bring to your attention that I don't think I'd done a good job, like, understanding that he... He... His goal was to, like, break everything down to its most simplest form. Right? So this is Ed Thor, talking about on how Shannon Dell with problems. And it says, the dark quote from Thor. Shannon seemed to think with ideas more than with words or formulas. A new problem was like a sculpt block of stone and Shannon ideas chiseled away the obstacles until an proxima solution emerged like an image, which he proceeded to refine as desired with more ideas. When I read that, I thought about the famous quote by Michael Angelo, when somebody asked them like, how do how are you creating these sculptures? And Michel michael Says the sculpture is already complete within the marble block before I start my work. It is already there. I just have to chi away at all the super super material. I think that's probably an idea that that that can be applied to to building a business to chi away. Like, take removing everything that's not essential. It's very hard. When you have think about all the products and service that you encounter. It's very very, very rare. That we're able to successfully do that. But I think it's powerful and you see it. I already said this before isn't but I apparently, I'd leave this note to myself a lot in the book. What motivated Shannon is if you can find a way for your work to overlap with your natural inclination inclination or your natural drift, you'll love a good light. So Shannon talking to us here he says I don't think I was ever motivated by the notion winning prizes. Although I have a couple of dozen dozen of them in that other room. I was more motivated by curiosity, never by the desire for financial gain. But he wants up achieving both. Right? Isn't that interesting that, like, some people think, like, chasing money, you'll get it... But there's a lot of examples when you chase what you're naturally curious about the money comes later. I just wanted to how things are put together. Of are what the laws or rules govern situation, or if there are theorem about what 1 can or can't do, mainly because I just wanted to know myself. This is 1 of the the... So later in his life, he he just stopped like, he'd he'd get honored so much. He wouldn't show up to, accept the awards. He didn't like traveling. But there were sometimes times where he could accept an award and his family wanted to see. So in this case, like, he he winds up accepting this word and going to to Japan just because his family wanted to see Japan. But this section isn't really about that too much It's it's about this idea that I always referenced that books of the original links. And so I just ordered some books on this person I never heard of before. And eventually, you know, we'll learn from them in in future episodes. But it said Claude had been had been selected as the first ever winner of the Kyoto prize and basic science, an award and endowed by the billionaire, Ka in A mori. So sorry, if you're listening to this in Japan, and I'm butchering this, I can I can't even pronounce normal words in English? So don't take offense, please. In Mori was a Japanese applied chemist who founded a multinational Kyo ser, and later rescue Japan's airlines from bankruptcy. He was an engineer by training, a zen buddhist by choice and a business turnaround artist by reputation. He was also a student of management philosophy, which along with his buddhism might explain why the Kyoto prizes founding letter reads like a curious mix of spiritual text and a shareholder updates. So this is why I'm put it in here because It's hilarious to me. And this is writing reading directly from that, from the founding letter. After a quarter of century of relentless and painstaking effort, Kyo Sara annual sales have by the grace of God, grown to 230000000000 yen with pre tax profits of 53 53000000000 yen. I I've decided on this occasion to create the Kyo kyoto prize. Those worthy of the Kyoto prize will be people who have as we as have we at Kyo worked humbly and devoted. Spa no effort to see perfection in their chosen professions. They will be individuals who are sensitive to their own human fall and who thereby hold a deep rooted reverence for excellence. So he's read a punch of books, Some of them like, I can't even find their in print. But I just ordered 2 of them. So hopefully are interesting. Interesting to me though, was, during this this successful speech in Japan. He talks about how he just has this random thought about how history should be taught. He says, I don't know How history he's taught here in Japan, but in the United States in my college days. Most of the time was spent on the study of political leaders in wars, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler. I think this is totally wrong. The important people and events of history are the thinkers and innovators. The Darwin's, newton and Beethoven, whose work continues to grow influence in a positive fashion. He continues. 1 category of innovation he single out for special mention, the discoveries of science. These are all gonna be future founders, by the way. As quote from Shannon, are wonderful achievements and themselves, but would not affect the life of the common man without the intermediate efforts of engineers and inventors. People, and he's gonna mention the people he myers. People like Edison, Bell, and Marco. Actually, just over a book on Marco. That's like, 826 pages. So I don't know what I just I just got myself into. And I've I've done 1 podcast. I think it's episode number 2 on Edison, but I will read other books on him in the future. And I haven't covered, Alex alexander or Rim bell. Yeah yet, but I will. This gives you an idea of more mortgage personality. And this is really on his... You can see he's kind of an introvert. This and why he had a strongest taste for war. This is Shannon on the human species. These goals meaning computing and automation and Ai robotics. These goals he said only half joking could mark the beginning of a phase out of the stupid, entropy increasing and militant human race, yikes. In favor of a more logical energy conserving and friendly species the computer. So he's saying, he's a they're kind of mirror images of themselves. Those 3 traits. Right? He considers a lot of humanity to be stupid. So he'd prefer more logical. That's the other side of that. Entropy increasing He would like energy conserving and militant instead of Milton, he would like friendly. It would be amazing if far species was was friendly to everybody isn't it? A completely different world than we live now. The end towards the end of the book, unfortunately, Shannon gets some alzheimer's disease, and it's it's actually really hard to read about, because you have this wonderful playful mind and, like, you know, starts to not recognize own children and just winds up dying in a assisted living facility, not far from his house just because he's falling down and just... It's... It was really, really sad. So I'm not gonna include any of that. And I don't wanna remember him that way. Because I got to the end of the book. And I was like, I always talk about this idea. Like, when you read a great book like this. Right? You get to the end and there's, like, I don't have a word for. I I've use the word, like, Bitter sweet, which I don't think is necessarily all the way accurate, but, like, you have, like, a mel colleague feel, like, you're you're very happy you're very happy that you read the book, but your sad is it's over. And especially, like, vast majority of people are cover on the on this podcast is like, they're dead. Like, that... Their life is done. There's nothing further that's gonna happen. And the final finale evolves. Like, it's a... It's a pleasant and at the same time uncomfortable emotional experience that I want more of. That's 1 of the I and anybody's who's read great books knows what exactly I'm talking about. And I think part of it stems from, like, you just been a great deal of time. You know, like, if you're gonna read a book, this book, I think was, like 300 pages to me. That's like a 10 hour read. And it just... There's just... You have, like an emotional release for lack of a better word at the end. And when I'm sitting here going over, like, what I wanted to talk to you about today I was, I don't wanna end on that, man. That's like, it just... It's... You know, you... He becomes a extremely likable character over the entire book and then he dies in, like a devastating way. And it's just like, I... It's it's unpleasant. It's like heartbreaking. But also, like, you're heartbroken that that happened, but you're also very happy that you somebody took the time to write these words down. And, like, you not now like, you know about this the life of this person, you know? I don't know. I find that fasting. Maybe that's why Like reading biography so much. But anyways, I wanna end here, and it's it's his idea for his funeral, which you're gonna see is not bleak. And it shows you like, why? I keep referencing order again and why this book called to mind at play? Because that's how you approach life, man? And I want that trade for myself? Like I want. I even thought about that since I read the book this week where Like, I had something like, you know, if you you're You have things that annoy you during the week here. Like, I was having some, like, slight annoy. I'm like, this is not. Like, enjoy life, man. This is all gonna be over. Everything around you is temporary. Like, don't let these little things bother you like, just enjoy. Fact I'm alive. I'm surrounded by loved ones. Like, I'm so far in like, good health. Like, just don't let these old things ruin your... This journey this experience if we call life. So give you an idea of how Caught Shannon did that you're gonna this is the most unique idea. He had an... He had a very specific idea. Unfortunately, his funeral doesn't wind up being like this, but this is the way he wanted it. And I think this is a good way to, like, close the time that we have together talking about call Shannon. Shannon had his his had set his mind to the question of this funeral and imagine something very different. For him, it was an occasion that called for humor, not grief. In a rough sketch, he outlined a grand procession. A Macy's style parade to muse and to delight and to sum up the life of Claude Shannon. The cla, Pete Fountain would lead the way. Jazz combo in tow. So remember, I'm gonna explain this to you. Think of used that visualization your mind while I'm speaking of a Macy's style parade. This is... This is his funeral possession. So we got Cla, Pete Fountain would lead the way. He's up front. He's got a jazz combo and toe behind him. Next in line, 6 uni cycling pal bears, somehow balancing sharon Shannon coffin. Behind them would come the grieving widow, then a juggling oc and a juggling oc pedal machine. Next would be the 3 black chess pieces bearing hundred dollar bills, and then 3 rich men from the west, California tech investors following the money. They would march in front of a chest float a atop which British chess master David Levy would square off in a live chess match against the computer. Then you'd have scientists and mathematicians, 4 cats trained by the skinner methods, the mouse grew a failing a fail of jog because he took up jogging later on his life was 1 of his, and a 417 instrument band would bring up the rear. I just love that part. And I think that's, like, AAA great parting way to think about, to think about cloud Shannon. So I'm gonna leave the story here. Oh, if you want the full story, I'd recommend buying the book, Not only are you supporting yourself? Because how many times do you read a great book and and wind up regretting that, very few. You're supporting the authors who spend years and, working, so we can actually learn and, their work serves the foundation of the discussions. We have every week? And you can also support the podcast. If you use the link that's in the show notes, Amazon sending me a small percentage of the... Sale no additional cost to you.
